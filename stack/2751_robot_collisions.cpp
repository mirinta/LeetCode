/**
 * There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.
 *
 * You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i]
 * is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.
 *
 * All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions.
 * If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.
 *
 * If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of
 * the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was
 * going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.
 *
 * Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order
 * that the robots were given, i.e. final heath of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2
 * (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.
 *
 * Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in
 * the input), after no further collisions can occur.
 *
 * Note: The positions may be unsorted.
 *
 * ! 1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= positions[i], healths[i] <= 10^9
 * ! directions[i] == 'L' or directions[i] == 'R'
 * ! All values in positions are distinct
