/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed matrix grid of order n * n. Each cell in this matrix has a value
 * grid[i][j], which is either a positive integer or -1 representing a blocked cell.
 *
 * You can move from a non-blocked cell to any non-blocked cell that shares an edge.
 *
 * For any cell (i, j), we represent its remoteness as R[i][j] which is defined as the following:
 *
 * - If the cell (i, j) is a non-blocked cell, R[i][j] is the sum of the values grid[x][y] such that
 * there is no path from the non-blocked cell (x, y) to the cell (i, j).
 *
 * - For blocked cells, R[i][j] == 0.
 *
 * Return the sum of R[i][j] over all cells.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 300
 * !1 <= grid[i][j] <= 106 or grid[i][j] == -1
