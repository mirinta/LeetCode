/**
 * You are given an integer matrix isWater of size m x n that represents a map of land and water
 * cells.
 *
 * - If isWater[i][j] == 0, cell (i, j) is a land cell.
 *
 * - If isWater[i][j] == 1, cell (i, j) is a water cell.
 *
 * You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:
 *
 * - The height of each cell must be non-negative.
 *
 * - If the cell is a water cell, its height must be 0.
 *
 * - Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1. A cell is adjacent
 * to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their
 * sides are touching).
 *
 * Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is maximized.
 *
 * Return an integer matrix height of size m x n where height[i][j] is cell (i, j)'s height. If
 * there are multiple solutions, return any of them.
 *
 * ! m == isWater.length
 * ! n == isWater[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 1000
 * ! isWater[i][j] is 0 or 1.
 * ! There is at least one water cell.
