/**
 * You are given two m x n binary matrices grid1 and grid2 containing only 0's (representing water)
 * and 1's (representing land). An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontal or
 * vertical). Any cells outside of the grid are considered water cells.
 *
 * An island in grid2 is considered a sub-island if there is an island in grid1 that contains all
 * the cells that make up this island in grid2.
 *
 * Return the number of islands in grid2 that are considered sub-islands.
 *
 * ! m == grid1.length == grid2.length
 * ! n == grid1[i].length == grid2[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 500
 * ! grid1[i][j] and grid2[i][j] are either 0 or 1.
