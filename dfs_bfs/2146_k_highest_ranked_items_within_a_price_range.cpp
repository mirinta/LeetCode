/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n that represents a map of the items
 * in a shop. The integers in the grid represent the following:
 *
 * - 0 represents a wall that you cannot pass through.
 *
 * - 1 represents an empty cell that you can freely move to and from.
 *
 * - All other positive integers represent the price of an item in that cell. You may also freely
 * move to and from these item cells. It takes 1 step to travel between adjacent grid cells.
 *
 * You are also given integer arrays pricing and start where pricing = [low, high] and start = [row,
 * col] indicates that you start at the position (row, col) and are interested only in items with a
 * price in the range of [low, high] (inclusive). You are further given an integer k.
 *
 * You are interested in the positions of the k highest-ranked items whose prices are within the
 * given price range. The rank is determined by the first of these criteria that is different:
 *
 * 1. Distance, defined as the length of the shortest path from the start (shorter distance has a
 * higher rank).
 *
 * 2. Price (lower price has a higher rank, but it must be in the price range).
 *
 * 3. The row number (smaller row number has a higher rank).
 *
 * 4. The column number (smaller column number has a higher rank).
 *
 * Return the k highest-ranked items within the price range sorted by their rank (highest to
 * lowest). If there are fewer than k reachable items within the price range, return all of them.
 *
 * ! m == grid.length
 * ! n == grid[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= m * n <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^5
 * ! pricing.length == 2
 * ! 2 <= low <= high <= 10^5
 * ! start.length == 2
 * ! 0 <= row <= m - 1
 * ! 0 <= col <= n - 1
 * ! grid[row][col] > 0
 * ! 1 <= k <= m * n
