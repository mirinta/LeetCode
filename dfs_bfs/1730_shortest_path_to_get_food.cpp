/**
 * You are starving and you want to eat food as quickly as possible. You want to find the shortest
 * path to arrive at any food cell.
 *
 * You are given an m x n character matrix, grid, of these different types of cells:
 *
 * - '*' is your location. There is exactly one '*' cell.
 *
 * - '#' is a food cell. There may be multiple food cells.
 *
 * - 'O' is free space, and you can travel through these cells.
 *
 * - 'X' is an obstacle, and you cannot travel through these cells.
 *
 * You can travel to any adjacent cell north, east, south, or west of your current location if there
 * is not an obstacle.
 *
 * Return the length of the shortest path for you to reach any food cell. If there is no path for
 * you to reach food, return -1.
 *
 * ! m == grid.length
 * ! n == grid[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 200
 * ! grid[row][col] is '*', 'X', 'O', or '#'.
 * ! The grid contains exactly one '*'.
