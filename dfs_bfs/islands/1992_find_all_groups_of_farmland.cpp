/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix land where a 0 represents a hectare of forested
 * land and a 1 represents a hectare of farmland.
 *
 * To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist
 * entirely of farmland. These rectangular areas are called groups. No two groups are adjacent,
 * meaning farmland in one group is not four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a
 * different group.
 *
 * land can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of land is (0, 0) and
 * the bottom right corner of land is (m-1, n-1). Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom
 * right corner of each group of farmland. A group of farmland with a top left corner at (r1, c1)
 * and a bottom right corner at (r2, c2) is represented by the 4-length array [r1, c1, r2, c2].
 *
 * Return a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each group of farmland in
 * land. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in any
 * order.
 *
 * ! m == land.length
 * ! n == land[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 300
 * ! land consists of only 0's and 1's.
 * ! Groups of farmland are rectangular in shape.
