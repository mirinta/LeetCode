/**
 * You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and
 * grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.
 *
 * Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely
 * surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
 *
 * The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the
 * island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't
 * exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
 *
 * ! row == grid.length
 * ! col == grid[i].length
 * ! 1 <= row, col <= 100
 * ! grid[i][j] is 0 or 1.
 * ! There is exactly one island in grid.
