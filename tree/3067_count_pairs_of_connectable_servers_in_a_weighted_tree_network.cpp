/**
 * You are given an unrooted weighted tree with n vertices representing servers numbered from 0 to n
 * - 1, an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti] represents a bidirectional edge between
 * vertices ai and bi of weight weighti. You are also given an integer signalSpeed.
 *
 * Two servers a and b are connectable through a server c if:
 *
 * - a < b, a != c and b != c.
 *
 * - The distance from c to a is divisible by signalSpeed.
 *
 * - The distance from c to b is divisible by signalSpeed.
 *
 * - The path from c to b and the path from c to a do not share any edges.
 *
 * Return an integer array count of length n where count[i] is the number of server pairs that are
 * connectable through the server i.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 1000
 * ! edges.length == n - 1
 * ! edges[i].length == 3
 * ! 0 <= ai, bi < n
 * ! edges[i] = [ai, bi, weighti]
 * ! 1 <= weighti <= 10^6
 * ! 1 <= signalSpeed <= 10^6
 * ! The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.
