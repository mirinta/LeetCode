/**
 * There exists an undirected and initially unrooted tree with n nodes indexed from 0 to n - 1. You
 * are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi]
 * indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
 *
 * Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array price, where price[i] is the
 * price of the ith node.
 *
 * The price sum of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on that path.
 *
 * The tree can be rooted at any node root of your choice. The incurred cost after choosing root is
 * the difference between the maximum and minimum price sum amongst all paths starting at root.
 *
 * Return the maximum possible cost amongst all possible root choices.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! edges.length == n - 1
 * ! 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
 * ! edges represents a valid tree.
 * ! price.length == n
 * ! 1 <= price[i] <= 10^5
