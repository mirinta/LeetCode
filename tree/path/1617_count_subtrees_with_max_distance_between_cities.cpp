/**
 * There are n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are given an array edges of size n-1, where edges[i]
 * = [ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge between cities ui and vi. There exists a unique path
 * between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.
 *
 * A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the
 * subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two
 * subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.
 *
 * For each d from 1 to n-1, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any
 * two cities in the subtree is equal to d.
 *
 * Return an array of size n-1 where the dth element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which
 * the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to d.
 *
 * Notice that the distance between the two cities is the number of edges in the path between them.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 15
 * ! edges.length == n-1
 * ! edges[i].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= ui, vi <= n
 * ! All pairs (ui, vi) are distinct.
