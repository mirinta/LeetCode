 * the tree are unique.
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q
 * in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node
 * to be a descendant of itself)". A descendant of a node x is a node y that is on the path from
 * node x to some leaf node.
 *
 * ! The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
 * ! -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
 * ! All Node.val are unique.
 * ! p != q
