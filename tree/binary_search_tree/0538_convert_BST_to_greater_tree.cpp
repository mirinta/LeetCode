/**
 * Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of
 * the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the
 * original key in BST.
 *
 * As a reminder, a binary search tree is a tree that satisfies these constraints:
 *
 * - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
 *
 * - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
 *
 * - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 * ! The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].
 * ! -10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
 * ! All the values in the tree are unique.
 * ! root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
 *
 * ! This question is the same as LC 1038.
