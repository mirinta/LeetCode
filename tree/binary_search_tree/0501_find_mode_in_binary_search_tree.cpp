 * Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, return all the mode(s) (i.e., the

 *
 * If the tree has more than one mode, return them in any order.
 *
 * Assume a BST is defined as follows:
 *
 * - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
 *
 * - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's
 * key.
 *
 * - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
 *
 * ! The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
 * ! -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
 *
 * ! Could you do that without using any extra space?
 * ! Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count.
