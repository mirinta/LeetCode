/**
 * Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer target, split the tree into two
 * subtrees where the first subtree has nodes that are all smaller or equal to the target value,
 * while the second subtree has all nodes that are greater than the target value. It is not
 * necessarily the case that the tree contains a node with the value target.
 *
 * Additionally, most of the structure of the original tree should remain. Formally, for any child c
 * with parent p in the original tree, if they are both in the same subtree after the split, then
 * node c should still have the parent p.
 *
 * Return an array of the two roots of the two subtrees in order.
 *
 * ! The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 50].
 * ! 0 <= Node.val, target <= 1000
