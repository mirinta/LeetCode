/**
 * A word's generalized abbreviation can be constructed by taking any number of non-overlapping and
 * non-adjacent substrings and replacing them with their respective lengths.
 *
 * For example, "abcde" can be abbreviated into:
 *
 * - "a3e" ("bcd" turned into "3")
 *
 * - "1bcd1" ("a" and "e" both turned into "1")
 *
 * - "5" ("abcde" turned into "5")
 *
 * - "abcde" (no substrings replaced)
 *
 * However, these abbreviations are invalid:
 *
 * - "23" ("ab" turned into "2" and "cde" turned into "3") is invalid as the substrings chosen are
 * adjacent.
 *
 * - "22de" ("ab" turned into "2" and "bc" turned into "2") is invalid as the substring chosen
 * overlap.
 *
 * Given a string word, return a list of all the possible generalized abbreviations of word. Return
 * the answer in any order.
 *
 * ! 1 <= word.length <= 15
 * ! word consists of only lowercase English letters.
