/**
 * Given an integer n, find a sequence that satisfies all of the following:
 *
 * - The integer 1 occurs once in the sequence.
 *
 * - Each integer between 2 and n occurs twice in the sequence.
 *
 * - For every integer i between 2 and n, the distance between the two occurrences of i is exactly
 * i.
 *
 * The distance between two numbers on the sequence, a[i] and a[j], is the absolute difference of
 * their indices, |j - i|.
 *
 * Return the lexicographically largest sequence. It is guaranteed that under the given constraints,
 * there is always a solution.
 *
 * A sequence a is lexicographically larger than a sequence b (of the same length) if in the first
 * position where a and b differ, sequence a has a number greater than the corresponding number in
 * b. For example, [0,1,9,0] is lexicographically larger than [0,1,5,6] because the first position
 * they differ is at the third number, and 9 is greater than 5.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 20
