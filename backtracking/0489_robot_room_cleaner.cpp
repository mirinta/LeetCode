/**
 * You are controlling a robot that is located somewhere in a room. The room is modeled as an m x n
 * binary grid where 0 represents a wall and 1 represents an empty slot.
 *
 * The robot starts at an unknown location in the room that is guaranteed to be empty, and you do
 * not have access to the grid, but you can move the robot using the given API Robot.
 *
 * You are tasked to use the robot to clean the entire room (i.e., clean every empty cell in the
 * room). The robot with the four given APIs can move forward, turn left, or turn right. Each turn
 * is 90 degrees.
 *
 * When the robot tries to move into a wall cell, its bumper sensor detects the obstacle, and it
 * stays on the current cell.
 *
 * Note that the initial direction of the robot will be facing up. You can assume all four edges of
 * the grid are all surrounded by a wall.
 *
 * Custom testing:
 *
 * The input is only given to initialize the room and the robot's position internally. You must
 * solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must control the robot using only the four
 * mentioned APIs without knowing the room layout and the initial robot's position.
 *
 * ! m == room.length
 * ! n == room[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m <= 100
 * ! 1 <= n <= 200
 * ! room[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
 * ! 0 <= row < m
 * ! 0 <= col < n
 * ! room[row][col] == 1
 * ! All the empty cells can be visited from the starting position.
