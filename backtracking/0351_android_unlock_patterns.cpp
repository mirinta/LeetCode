/**
 * Android devices have a special lock screen with a 3 x 3 grid of dots. Users can set an "unlock
 * pattern" by connecting the dots in a specific sequence, forming a series of joined line segments
 * where each segment's endpoints are two consecutive dots in the sequence. A sequence of k dots is
 * a valid unlock pattern if both of the following are true:
 *
 * - All the dots in the sequence are distinct.
 *
 * - If the line segment connecting two consecutive dots in the sequence passes through the center
 *   of any other dot, the other dot must have previously appeared in the sequence. No jumps through
 *   the center non-selected dots are allowed.
 *
 *   - For example, connecting dots 2 and 9 without dots 5 or 6 appearing beforehand is valid
 *     because the line from dot 2 to dot 9 does not pass through the center of either dot 5 or 6.
 *
 *   - However, connecting dots 1 and 3 without dot 2 appearing beforehand is invalid because the
 *     line from dot 1 to dot 3 passes through the center of dot 2.
 *
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 9
