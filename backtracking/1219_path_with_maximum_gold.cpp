/**
 * In a gold mine grid of size m x n, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount
 * of gold in that cell, 0 if it is empty.
 *
 * Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:
 *
 * - Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
 *
 * - From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
 *
 * - You can't visit the same cell more than once.
 *
 * - Never visit a cell with 0 gold.
 *
 * - You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.
 *
 * ! m == grid.length
 * ! n == grid[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 15
 * ! 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
 * ! There are at most 25 cells containing gold.
