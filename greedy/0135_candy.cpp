 * There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the
 * integer array ratings.
 *
 * You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
 *
 * - Each child must have at least one candy.
 *
 * - Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.
 *
 * ! n == ratings.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
