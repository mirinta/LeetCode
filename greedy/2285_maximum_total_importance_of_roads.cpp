/**
 * You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered
 * from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 * You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a
 * bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.
 *
 * You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used
 * once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it
 * connects.
 *
 * Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.
 *
 * 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * 1 <= roads.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * roads[i].length == 2
 * 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
 * ai != bi
 * There are no duplicate roads.
