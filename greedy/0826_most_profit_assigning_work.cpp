/**
 * You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:
 *
 * - difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
 *
 * - worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with
 * difficulty at most worker[j]).
 *
 * Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.
 *
 * - For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be
 * $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.
 *
 * Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.
 *
 * ! n == difficulty.length
 * ! n == profit.length
 * ! m == worker.length
 * ! 1 <= n, m <= 10^4
 * ! 1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 10^5
