/**
 * There is a large (m - 1) x (n - 1) rectangular field with corners at (1, 1) and (m, n) containing
 * some horizontal and vertical fences given in arrays hFences and vFences respectively.
 *
 * Horizontal fences are from the coordinates (hFences[i], 1) to (hFences[i], n) and vertical fences
 * are from the coordinates (1, vFences[i]) to (m, vFences[i]).
 *
 * Return the maximum area of a square field that can be formed by removing some fences (possibly
 * none) or -1 if it is impossible to make a square field.
 *
 * Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * Note: The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the coordinates (1, 1) to (1, n) and
 * (m, 1) to (m, n) and two vertical fences from the coordinates (1, 1) to (m, 1) and (1, n) to (m,
 * n). These fences cannot be removed.
 *
 * ! 3 <= m, n <= 10^9
 * ! 1 <= hFences.length, vFences.length <= 600
 * ! 1 < hFences[i] < m
 * ! 1 < vFences[i] < n
 * ! hFences and vFences are unique.
