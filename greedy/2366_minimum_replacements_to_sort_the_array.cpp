/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation you can replace any element of the
 * array with any two elements that sum to it.
 *
 * - For example, consider nums = [5,6,7]. In one operation, we can replace nums[1] with 2 and 4 and
 * convert nums to [5,2,4,7].
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations to make an array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
 * ! 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
