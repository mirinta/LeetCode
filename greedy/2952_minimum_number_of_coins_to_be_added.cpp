/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array coins, representing the values of the coins available,
 * and an integer target.
 *
 * An integer x is obtainable if there exists a subsequence of coins that sums to x.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of coins of any value that need to be added to the array so that every
 * integer in the range [1, target] is obtainable.
 *
 * A subsequence of an array is a new non-empty array that is formed from the original array by
 * deleting some (possibly none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the
 * remaining elements.
 *
 * ! 1 <= target <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= coins.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= coins[i] <= target
