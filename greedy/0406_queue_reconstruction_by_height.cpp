/**
 * You are given an array of people, people, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not
 * necessarily in order). Each people[i] = [hi, ki] represents the ith person of height hi with
 * exactly ki other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to hi.
 *
 * Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array people. The returned
 * queue should be formatted as an array queue, where queue[j] = [hj, kj] is the attributes of the
 * jth person in the queue (queue[0] is the person at the front of the queue).
 *
 * ! 1 <= people.length <= 2000
 * ! 0 <= hi <= 10^6
 * ! 0 <= ki < people.length
 * ! It is guaranteed that the queue can be reconstructed.
