/**
 * There is a 1-indexed 8 x 8 chessboard containing 3 pieces.
 *
 * You are given 6 integers a, b, c, d, e, and f where:
 *
 * - (a, b) denotes the position of the white rook.
 *
 * - (c, d) denotes the position of the white bishop.
 *
 * - (e, f) denotes the position of the black queen.
 *
 * Given that you can only move the white pieces, return the minimum number of moves required to
 * capture the black queen.
 *
 * Note that:
 *
 * Rooks can move any number of squares either vertically or horizontally, but cannot jump over
 * other pieces. Bishops can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot jump over other
 * pieces. A rook or a bishop can capture the queen if it is located in a square that they can move
 * to. The queen does not move.
 *
 * ! 1 <= a, b, c, d, e, f <= 8
 * ! No two pieces are on the same square.
