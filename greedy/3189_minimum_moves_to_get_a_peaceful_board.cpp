/**
 * Given a 2D array rooks of length n, where rooks[i] = [xi, yi] indicates the position of a rook on
 * an n x n chess board. Your task is to move the rooks 1 cell at a time vertically or horizontally
 * (to an adjacent cell) such that the board becomes peaceful.
 *
 * A board is peaceful if there is exactly one rook in each row and each column.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of moves required to get a peaceful board.
 *
 * Note that at no point can there be two rooks in the same cell.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n == rooks.length <= 500
 * ! 0 <= xi, yi <= n - 1
 * ! The input is generated such that there are no 2 rooks in the same cell.
