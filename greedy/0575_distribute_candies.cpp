/**
 * Alice has n candies, where the ith candy is of type candyType[i]. Alice noticed that she started
 * to gain weight, so she visited a doctor.
 *
 * The doctor advised Alice to only eat n / 2 of the candies she has (n is always even). Alice likes
 * her candies very much, and she wants to eat the maximum number of different types of candies
 * while still following the doctor's advice.
 *
 * Given the integer array candyType of length n, return the maximum number of different types of
 * candies she can eat if she only eats n / 2 of them.
 *
 * ! n == candyType.length
 * ! 2 <= n <= 10^4
 * ! n is even.
 * ! -10^5 <= candyType[i] <= 10^5
