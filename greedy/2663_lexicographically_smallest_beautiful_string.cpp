/**
 * A string is beautiful if:
 *
 * - It consists of the first k letters of the English lowercase alphabet.
 *
 * - It does not contain any substring of length 2 or more which is a palindrome.
 *
 * You are given a beautiful string s of length n and a positive integer k.
 *
 * Return the lexicographically smallest string of length n, which is larger than s and is
 * beautiful. If there is no such string, return an empty string.
 *
 * A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first
 * position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character
 * in b.
 *
 * - For example, "abcd" is lexicographically larger than "abcc" because the first position they
 * differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n == s.length <= 105
 * ! 4 <= k <= 26
 * ! s is a beautiful string.
