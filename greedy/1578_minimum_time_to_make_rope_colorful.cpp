/**
 * Alice has n balloons arranged on a rope. You are given a 0-indexed string colors where colors[i]
 * is the color of the ith balloon.
 *
 * Alice wants the rope to be colorful. She does not want two consecutive balloons to be of the same
 * color, so she asks Bob for help. Bob can remove some balloons from the rope to make it colorful.
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array neededTime where neededTime[i] is the time (in seconds)
 * that Bob needs to remove the ith balloon from the rope.
 *
 * Return the minimum time Bob needs to make the rope colorful.
 *
 * ! n == colors.length == neededTime.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= neededTime[i] <= 10^4
 * ! colors contains only lowercase English letters.
