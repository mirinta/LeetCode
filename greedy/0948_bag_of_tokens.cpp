/**
 * You start with an initial power of power, an initial score of 0, and a bag of tokens given as an
 * integer array tokens, where each tokens[i] donates the value of tokeni.
 *
 * Your goal is to maximize the total score by strategically playing these tokens. In one move, you
 * can play an unplayed token in one of the two ways (but not both for the same token):
 *
 * - Face-up: If your current power is at least tokens[i], you may play tokeni, losing tokens[i]
 * power and gaining 1 score.
 *
 * - Face-down: If your current score is at least 1, you may play tokeni, gaining tokens[i] power
 * and losing 1 score.
 *
 * Return the maximum possible score you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.
 *
 * ! 0 <= tokens.length <= 1000
 * ! 0 <= tokens[i], power < 10^4
