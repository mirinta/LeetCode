/**
 * A competition consists of n players numbered from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 * You are given an integer array skills of size n and a positive integer k, where skills[i] is the
 * skill level of player i. All integers in skills are unique.
 *
 * All players are standing in a queue in order from player 0 to player n - 1.
 *
 * The competition process is as follows:
 *
 * - The first two players in the queue play a game, and the player with the higher skill level
 * wins.
 *
 * - After the game, the winner stays at the beginning of the queue, and the loser goes to the end
 * of it. The winner of the competition is the first player who wins k games in a row.
 *
 * Return the initial index of the winning player.
 *
 * ! n == skills.length
 * ! 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= k <= 10^9
 * ! 1 <= skills[i] <= 10^6
 * ! All integers in skills are unique.
