/**
 * You are given a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi]. You are also given an
 * integer w. Your task is to cover all the given points with rectangles.
 *
 * Each rectangle has its lower end at some point (x1, 0) and its upper end at some point (x2, y2),
 * where x1 <= x2, y2 >= 0, and the condition x2 - x1 <= w must be satisfied for each rectangle.
 *
 * A point is considered covered by a rectangle if it lies within or on the boundary of the
 * rectangle.
 *
 * Return an integer denoting the minimum number of rectangles needed so that each point is covered
 * by at least one rectangle.
 *
 * Note: A point may be covered by more than one rectangle.
 *
 * ! 1 <= points.length <= 10^5
 * ! points[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= xi == points[i][0] <= 10^9
 * ! 0 <= yi == points[i][1] <= 10^9
 * ! 0 <= w <= 10^9
 * ! All pairs (xi, yi) are distinct.
