/**
 * There are n seats and n students in a room. You are given an array seats of length n, where

 *
 * You may perform the following move any number of times:
 *
 * Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1 (i.e., moving the ith student from
 * position x to x + 1 or x - 1) Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to
 * a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.
 *
 * Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.
