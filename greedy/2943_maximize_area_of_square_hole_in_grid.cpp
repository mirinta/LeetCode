/**
 * There is a grid with n + 2 horizontal bars and m + 2 vertical bars, and initially containing 1 x
 * 1 unit cells.
 *
 * The bars are 1-indexed.
 *
 * You are given the two integers, n and m.
 *
 * You are also given two integer arrays: hBars and vBars.
 *
 * - hBars contains distinct horizontal bars in the range [2, n + 1].
 *
 * - vBars contains distinct vertical bars in the range [2, m + 1].
 *
 * You are allowed to remove bars that satisfy any of the following conditions:
 *
 * - If it is a horizontal bar, it must correspond to a value in hBars.
 *
 * - If it is a vertical bar, it must correspond to a value in vBars.
 *
 * Return an integer denoting the maximum area of a square-shaped hole in the grid after removing
 * some bars (possibly none).
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 109
 * ! 1 <= m <= 109
 * ! 1 <= hBars.length <= 100
 * ! 2 <= hBars[i] <= n + 1
 * ! 1 <= vBars.length <= 100
 * ! 2 <= vBars[i] <= m + 1
 * ! All values in hBars are distinct.
 * ! All values in vBars are distinct.
