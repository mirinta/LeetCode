/**
 * You are given a string word containing distinct lowercase English letters.
 *
 * Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which
 * can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a","b","c"],
 * we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c".
 *
 * It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can
 * be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need
 * to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.
 *
 * An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1, *, #,
 * and 0 do not map to any letters.
 *
 * ! 1 <= word.length <= 10^5
 * ! word consists of lowercase English letters.
