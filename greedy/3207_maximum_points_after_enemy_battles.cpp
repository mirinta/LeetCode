/**
 * You are given an integer array enemyEnergies denoting the energy values of various enemies.
 *
 * You are also given an integer currentEnergy denoting the amount of energy you have initially.
 *
 * You start with 0 points, and all the enemies are unmarked initially.
 *
 * You can perform either of the following operations zero or multiple times to gain points:
 *
 * - Choose an unmarked enemy, i, such that currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[i]. By choosing this
 *   option:
 *
 *   - You gain 1 point.
 *
 *   - Your energy is reduced by the enemy's energy, i.e. currentEnergy = currentEnergy -
 *     enemyEnergies[i].
 *
 * - If you have at least 1 point, you can choose an unmarked enemy, i. By choosing
 *   this option:
 *
 *   - Your energy increases by the enemy's energy, i.e. currentEnergy = currentEnergy +
 *     enemyEnergies[i].
 *
 *   - The enemy i is marked.
 *
 * Return an integer denoting the maximum points you can get in the end by optimally performing
 * operations.
 *
 * ! 1 <= enemyEnergies.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= enemyEnergies[i] <= 10^9
 * ! 0 <= currentEnergy <= 10^9
