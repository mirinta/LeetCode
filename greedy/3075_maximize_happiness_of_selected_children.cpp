/**
 * You are given an array happiness of length n, and a positive integer k.
 *
 * There are n children standing in a queue, where the ith child has happiness value happiness[i].
 * You want to select k children from these n children in k turns.
 *
 * In each turn, when you select a child, the happiness value of all the children that have not been
 * selected till now decreases by 1. Note that the happiness value cannot become negative and gets
 * decremented only if it is positive.
 *
 * Return the maximum sum of the happiness values of the selected children you can achieve by
 * selecting k children.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n == happiness.length <= 2 * 10^5
 * ! 1 <= happiness[i] <= 10^8
 * ! 1 <= k <= n
