/**
 * There are n gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the ith station is
 * gas[i].
 *
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from the ith
 * station to its next (i + 1)th station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas
 * stations.
 *
 * Given two integer arrays gas and cost, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel
 * around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1. If there exists a
 * solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
 *
 * ! n == gas.length == cost.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= gas[i], cost[i] <= 10^4
