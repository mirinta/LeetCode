/**
 * You are given an array of positive integers arr. Perform some operations (possibly none) on arr
 * so that it satisfies these conditions:
 *
 * - The value of the first element in arr must be 1.
 *
 * - The absolute difference between any 2 adjacent elements must be less than or equal to 1. In
 * other words, abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) <= 1 for each i where 1 <= i < arr.length (0-indexed).
 * abs(x) is the absolute value of x.
 *
 * There are 2 types of operations that you can perform any number of times:
 *
 * - Decrease the value of any element of arr to a smaller positive integer.
 *
 * - Rearrange the elements of arr to be in any order.
 *
 * Return the maximum possible value of an element in arr after performing the operations to satisfy
 * the conditions.
 *
 * ! 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
