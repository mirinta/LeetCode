/**
 * You are given two strings stamp and target. Initially, there is a string s of length
 * target.length with all s[i] == '?'.
 *
 * In one turn, you can place stamp over s and replace every letter in the s with the corresponding
 * letter from stamp.
 *
 * For example, if stamp = "abc" and target = "abcba", then s is "?????" initially. In one turn you
 * can:
 *
 * - place stamp at index 0 of s to obtain "abc??",
 *
 * - place stamp at index 1 of s to obtain "?abc?", or
 *
 * - place stamp at index 2 of s to obtain "??abc".
 *
 * Note that stamp must be fully contained in the boundaries of s in order to stamp (i.e., you
 * cannot place stamp at index 3 of s).
 *
 * We want to convert s to target using at most 10 * target.length turns.
 *
 * Return an array of the index of the left-most letter being stamped at each turn. If we cannot
 * obtain target from s within 10 * target.length turns, return an empty array.
 *
 * ! 1 <= stamp.length <= target.length <= 1000
 * ! stamp and target consist of lowercase English letters.
