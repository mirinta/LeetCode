/**
 * You are given an array apple of size n and an array capacity of size m.
 *
 * There are n packs where the ith pack contains apple[i] apples. There are m boxes as well, and the
 * ith box has a capacity of capacity[i] apples.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples
 * into boxes.
 *
 * Note that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n == apple.length <= 50
 * ! 1 <= m == capacity.length <= 50
 * ! 1 <= apple[i], capacity[i] <= 50
 * ! The input is generated such that it's possible to redistribute packs of apples into boxes.
