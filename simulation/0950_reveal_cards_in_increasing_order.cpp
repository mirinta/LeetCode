/**
 * You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique
 * integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].
 *
 * You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down
(unrevealed)
 * in one deck.
 *
 * You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:
 *
 * 1. Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
 *
 * 2. If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of
 * the deck.
 *
 * 3. If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
 *
 * Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.
 *
 * Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.
 *
 * ! 1 <= deck.length <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= deck[i] <= 10^6
 * ! All the values of deck are unique.
