/**
 * There are n people in a line queuing to buy tickets, where the 0th person is at the front of the
 * line and the (n - 1)th person is at the back of the line.
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array tickets of length n where the number of tickets that the
 * ith person would like to buy is tickets[i].
 *
 * Each person takes exactly 1 second to buy a ticket. A person can only buy 1 ticket at a time and
 * has to go back to the end of the line (which happens instantaneously) in order to buy more
 * tickets. If a person does not have any tickets left to buy, the person will leave the line.
 *
 * Return the time taken for the person at position k (0-indexed) to finish buying tickets.
 *
 * ! n == tickets.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 100
 * ! 1 <= tickets[i] <= 100
 * ! 0 <= k < n
