/**
 * You are given an integer n, the number of teams in a tournament that has strange rules:
 *
 * - If the current number of teams is even, each team gets paired with another team. A total of n /
 * 2 matches are played, and n / 2 teams advance to the next round.
 *
 * - If the current number of teams is odd, one team randomly advances in the tournament, and the
 * rest gets paired. A total of (n - 1) / 2 matches are played, and (n - 1) / 2 + 1 teams advance to
 * the next round.
 *
 * Return the number of matches played in the tournament until a winner is decided.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 200
