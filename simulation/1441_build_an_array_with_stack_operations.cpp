/**
 * You are given an integer array target and an integer n.
 *
 * You have an empty stack with the two following operations:
 *
 * - "Push": pushes an integer to the top of the stack.
 *
 * - "Pop": removes the integer on the top of the stack.
 *
 * You also have a stream of the integers in the range [1, n].
 *
 * Use the two stack operations to make the numbers in the stack (from the bottom to the top) equal
 * to target. You should follow the following rules:
 *
 * - If the stream of the integers is not empty, pick the next integer from the stream and push it
 * to the top of the stack.
 *
 * - If the stack is not empty, pop the integer at the top of the stack.
 *
 * - If, at any moment, the elements in the stack (from the bottom to the top) are equal to target,
 * do not read new integers from the stream and do not do more operations on the stack.
 *
 * Return the stack operations needed to build target following the mentioned rules. If there are
 * multiple valid answers, return any of them.
 *
 * ! 1 <= target.length <= 100
 * ! 1 <= n <= 100
 * ! 1 <= target[i] <= n
 * ! target is strictly increasing.
