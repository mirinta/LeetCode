/**
 * You start at the cell (rStart, cStart) of an rows x cols grid facing east. The northwest corner
 * is at the first row and column in the grid, and the southeast corner is at the last row and
 * column.
 *
 * You will walk in a clockwise spiral shape to visit every position in this grid. Whenever you move
 * outside the grid's boundary, we continue our walk outside the grid (but may return to the grid
 * boundary later.). Eventually, we reach all rows * cols spaces of the grid.
 *
 * Return an array of coordinates representing the positions of the grid in the order you visited
 * them.
 *
 * ! 1 <= rows, cols <= 100
 * ! 0 <= rStart < rows
