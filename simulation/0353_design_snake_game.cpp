/**
 * Design a Snake game that is played on a device with screen size height x width. Play the game
 * online if you are not familiar with the game.
 *
 * The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner (0, 0) with a length of 1 unit.
 *
 * You are given an array food where food[i] = (ri, ci) is the row and column position of a piece of
 * food that the snake can eat. When a snake eats a piece of food, its length and the game's score
 * both increase by 1.
 *
 * Each piece of food appears one by one on the screen, meaning the second piece of food will not
 * appear until the snake eats the first piece of food.
 *
 * When a piece of food appears on the screen, it is guaranteed that it will not appear on a block
 * occupied by the snake.
 *
 * The game is over if the snake goes out of bounds (hits a wall) or if its head occupies a space
 * that its body occupies after moving (i.e. a snake of length 4 cannot run into itself).
 *
 * Implement the SnakeGame class:
 *
 * - SnakeGame(int width, int height, int[][] food) Initializes the object with a screen of size
 * height x width and the positions of the food.
 *
 * - int move(String direction) Returns the score of the game after applying one direction move by
 * the snake. If the game is over, return -1.
 *
 * ! 1 <= width, height <= 10^4
 * ! 1 <= food.length <= 50
 * ! food[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= ri < height
 * ! 0 <= ci < width
 * ! direction.length == 1
 * ! direction is 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'.
 * ! At most 10^4 calls will be made to move.
