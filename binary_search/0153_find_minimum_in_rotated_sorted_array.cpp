/**
 * Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For
 * example, the array nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] might become:
 *
 * - [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
 *
 * - [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
 *
 * Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array
 * [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
 *
 * Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
 *
 * ! n == nums.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 5000
 * ! -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
 * ! All the integers of nums are unique.
 * ! nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
