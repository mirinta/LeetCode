/**
 * You are given an integer array ribbons, where ribbons[i] represents the length of the ith ribbon,
 * and an integer k. You may cut any of the ribbons into any number of segments of positive integer
 * lengths, or perform no cuts at all.
 *
 * For example, if you have a ribbon of length 4, you can:
 *
 * - Keep the ribbon of length 4,
 *
 * - Cut it into one ribbon of length 3 and one ribbon of length 1,
 *
 * - Cut it into two ribbons of length 2,
 *
 * - Cut it into one ribbon of length 2 and two ribbons of length 1, or
 *
 * - Cut it into four ribbons of length 1.
 *
 * Your task is to determine the maximum length of ribbon, x, that allows you to cut at least k
 * ribbons, each of length x. You can discard any leftover ribbon from the cuts. If it is impossible
 * to cut k ribbons of the same length, return 0.
 *
 * ! 1 <= ribbons.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= ribbons[i] <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= k <= 10^9
