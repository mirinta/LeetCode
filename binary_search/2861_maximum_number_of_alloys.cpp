/**
 * You are the owner of a company that creates alloys using various types of metals. There are n
 * different types of metals available, and you have access to k machines that can be used to create
 * alloys. Each machine requires a specific amount of each metal type to create an alloy.
 *
 * For the ith machine to create an alloy, it needs composition[i][j] units of metal of type j.
 * Initially, you have stock[i] units of metal type i, and purchasing one unit of metal type i costs
 * cost[i] coins.
 *
 * Given integers n, k, budget, a 1-indexed 2D array composition, and 1-indexed arrays stock and
 * cost, your goal is to maximize the number of alloys the company can create while staying within
 * the budget of budget coins.
 *
 * All alloys must be created with the same machine.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of alloys that the company can create.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n, k <= 100
 * ! 0 <= budget <= 108
 * ! composition.length == k
 * ! composition[i].length == n
 * ! 1 <= composition[i][j] <= 100
 * ! stock.length == cost.length == n
 * ! 0 <= stock[i] <= 108
 * ! 1 <= cost[i] <= 100
