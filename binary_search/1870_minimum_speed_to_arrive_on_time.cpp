/**
 * You are given a floating-point number hour, representing the amount of time you have to reach the
 * office. To commute to the office, you must take n trains in sequential order. You are also given
 * an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the distance (in kilometers) of the
 * ith train ride.
 *
 * Each train can only depart at an integer hour, so you may need to wait in between each train
 * ride.
 *
 * - For example, if the 1st train ride takes 1.5 hours, you must wait for an additional 0.5 hours
 * before you can depart on the 2nd train ride at the 2 hour mark.
 *
 * Return the minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour) that all the trains must
 * travel at for you to reach the office on time, or -1 if it is impossible to be on time.
 *
 * Tests are generated such that the answer will not exceed 107 and hour will have at most two
 * digits after the decimal point.
 *
 * ! n == dist.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= dist[i] <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= hour <= 10^9
 * ! There will be at most two digits after the decimal point in hour.
