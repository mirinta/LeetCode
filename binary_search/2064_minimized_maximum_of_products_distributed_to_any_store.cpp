/**
 * You are given an integer n indicating there are n specialty retail stores. There are m product
 * types of varying amounts, which are given as a 0-indexed integer array quantities, where
 * quantities[i] represents the number of products of the ith product type.
 *
 * You need to distribute all products to the retail stores following these rules:
 *
 * A store can only be given at most one product type but can be given any amount of it.
 * After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly 0). Let x
 * represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want x to be as small as
 * possible, i.e., you want to minimize the maximum number of products that are given to any store.
 * Return the minimum possible x.
 *
 * ! m == quantities.length
 * ! 1 <= m <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= quantities[i] <= 10^5
