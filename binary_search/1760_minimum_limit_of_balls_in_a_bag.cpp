/**
 * You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given
 * an integer maxOperations.
 *
 * You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:
 *
 * - Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
 *
 * - For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2
 * and 3 balls.
 *
 * Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the
 * operations.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.
 *
 * ! 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 10^9
