/**
 * There is a battle and n heroes are trying to defeat m monsters. You are given two 1-indexed
 * arrays of positive integers heroes and monsters of length n and m, respectively. heroes[i] is the
 * power of ith hero, and monsters[i] is the power of ith monster.
 *
 * The ith hero can defeat the jth monster if monsters[j] <= heroes[i].
 *
 * You are also given a 1-indexed array coins of length m consisting of positive integers. coins[i]
 * is the number of coins that each hero earns after defeating the ith monster.
 *
 * Return an array ans of length n where ans[i] is the maximum number of coins that the ith hero can
 * collect from this battle.
 *
 * Notes
 *
 * - The health of a hero doesn't get reduced after defeating a monster.
 *
 * - Multiple heroes can defeat a monster, but each monster can be defeated by a given hero only
 * once.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n == heroes.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= m == monsters.length <= 10^5
 * ! coins.length == m
 * ! 1 <= heroes[i], monsters[i], coins[i] <= 10^9
