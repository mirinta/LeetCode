/**
 * You have n computers. You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed integer array batteries where
 * the ith battery can run a computer for batteries[i] minutes. You are interested in running all n
 * computers simultaneously using the given batteries.
 *
 *
 * Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. After that and at any integer
 * time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery any number of
 * times. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You
 * may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.
 *
 * Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all the n computers simultaneously.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= batteries.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= batteries[i] <= 10^9
