/**
 * Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher
 * received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in ascending order, return the researcher's
 * h-index.
 *
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value
 * of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at
 * least h times.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
 *
 * ! n == citations.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= citations[i] <= 1000
 * ! citations is sorted in ascending order.
