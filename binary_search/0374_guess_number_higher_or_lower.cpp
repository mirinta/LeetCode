 * We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 *
 * I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 *
 * Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than
 * your guess.
 *
 * You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
 *
 * - -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
 *
 * - 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
 *
 * - 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
 *
 * Return the number that I picked.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
 * 1 <= pick <= n
