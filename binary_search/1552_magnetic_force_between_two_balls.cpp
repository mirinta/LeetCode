/**
 * In the universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls
 * if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n empty baskets, the ith basket is at
 * position[i], Morty has m balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the
 * minimum magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.
 *
 * Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x and y is |x - y|.
 *
 * Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required force.
 *
 * ! n == position.length
 * ! 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= position[i] <= 10^9
 * ! All integers in position are distinct.
 * ! 2 <= m <= position.length
