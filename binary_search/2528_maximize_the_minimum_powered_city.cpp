/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the
 * number of power stations in the ith city.
 *
 * Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range
 * is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i -
 * j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.
 *
 *
 * - Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.
 *
 * The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.
 *
 * The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any
 * city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.
 *
 * Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the
 * additional power stations are built optimally.
 *
 * Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.
 *
 * ! n == stations.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= stations[i] <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= r <= n - 1
 * ! 0 <= k <= 10^9
