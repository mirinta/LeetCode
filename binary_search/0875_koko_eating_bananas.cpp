/**
 * Koko loves to eat bananas. There are n piles of bananas, the ith pile has piles[i] bananas. The
 * guards have gone and will come back in h hours.
 *
 * Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed of k. Each hour, she chooses some pile of
 * bananas and eats k bananas from that pile. If the pile has less than k bananas, she eats all of
 * them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.
 *
 * Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards
 * return.
 *
 * Return the minimum integer k such that she can eat all the bananas within h hours.
 *
 * ! 1 <= piles.length <= 10^4
 * ! piles.length <= h <= 10^9
 * ! 1 <= piles[i] <= 10^9
