/**
 * There are several consecutive houses along a street, each of which has some money inside. There
 * is also a robber, who wants to steal money from the homes, but he refuses to steal from adjacent
 * homes.
 *
 * The capability of the robber is the maximum amount of money he steals from one house of all the
 * houses he robbed.
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums representing how much money is stashed in each house. More
 * formally, the ith house from the left has nums[i] dollars.
 *
 * You are also given an integer k, representing the minimum number of houses the robber will steal
 * from. It is always possible to steal at least k houses.
 *
 * Return the minimum capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least k
 * houses.
 *
 * ! 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * ! 1 <= k <= (nums.length + 1)/2
