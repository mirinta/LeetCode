/**
 * We have two arrays arr1 and arr2 which are initially empty. You need to add positive integers to
 * them such that they satisfy all the following conditions:
 *
 * - arr1 contains uniqueCnt1 distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by
 * divisor1.
 *
 * - arr2 contains uniqueCnt2 distinct positive integers, each of which is not divisible by
 * divisor2.
 *
 * - No integer is present in both arr1 and arr2.
 *
 * Given divisor1, divisor2, uniqueCnt1, and uniqueCnt2, return the minimum possible maximum integer
 * that can be present in either array.
 *
 * ! 2 <= divisor1, divisor2 <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= uniqueCnt1, uniqueCnt2 < 10^9
 * ! 2 <= uniqueCnt1 + uniqueCnt2 <= 10^9
