/**
 * You have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given
 * by the array sweetness.
 *
 * You want to share the chocolate with your k friends so you start cutting the chocolate bar into k
 * + 1 pieces using k cuts, each piece consists of some consecutive chunks.
 *
 * Being generous, you will eat the piece with the minimum total sweetness and give the other pieces
 * to your friends.
 *
 * Find the maximum total sweetness of the piece you can get by cutting the chocolate bar optimally.
 *
 * ! 0 <= k < sweetness.length <= 10^4
 * ! 1 <= sweetness[i] <= 10^5
