/**
 * A row-sorted binary matrix means that all elements are 0 or 1 and each row of the matrix is
 * sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
 * Given a row-sorted binary matrix binaryMatrix, return the index (0-indexed) of the leftmost
 * column with a 1 in it. If such an index does not exist, return -1.
 *
 * You can't access the Binary Matrix directly. You may only access the matrix using a BinaryMatrix
 * interface:
 *
 * - BinaryMatrix.get(row, col) returns the element of the matrix at index (row, col) (0-indexed).
 *
 * - BinaryMatrix.dimensions() returns the dimensions of the matrix as a list of 2 elements [rows,
 * cols], which means the matrix is rows x cols.
 *
 * Submissions making more than 1000 calls to BinaryMatrix.get will be judged Wrong Answer. Also,
 * any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.
 *
 * For custom testing purposes, the input will be the entire binary matrix mat. You will not have
 * access to the binary matrix directly.
 *
 * ! rows == mat.length
 * ! cols == mat[i].length
 * ! 1 <= rows, cols <= 100
 * ! mat[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
 * ! mat[i] is sorted in non-decreasing order.
