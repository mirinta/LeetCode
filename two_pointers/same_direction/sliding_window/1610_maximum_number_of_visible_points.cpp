/**
 * You are given an array points, an integer angle, and your location, where location = [posx, posy]
 * and points[i] = [xi, yi] both denote integral coordinates on the X-Y plane.
 *
 * Initially, you are facing directly east from your position. You cannot move from your position,
 * but you can rotate. In other words, posx and posy cannot be changed. Your field of view in
 * degrees is represented by angle, determining how wide you can see from any given view direction.
 * Let d be the amount in degrees that you rotate counterclockwise. Then, your field of view is the
 * inclusive range of angles [d - angle/2, d + angle/2].
