/**
 * A teacher is writing a test with n true/false questions, with 'T' denoting true and 'F' denoting
 * false. He wants to confuse the students by maximizing the number of consecutive questions with
 * the same answer (multiple trues or multiple falses in a row).
 *
 * You are given a string answerKey, where answerKey[i] is the original answer to the ith question.
 * In addition, you are given an integer k, the maximum number of times you may perform the
 * following operation:
 *
 * - Change the answer key for any question to 'T' or 'F' (i.e., set answerKey[i] to 'T' or 'F').
 *
 * Return the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key after performing the
 * operation at most k times.
 *
 * ! n == answerKey.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * ! answerKey[i] is either 'T' or 'F'
 * ! 1 <= k <= n
