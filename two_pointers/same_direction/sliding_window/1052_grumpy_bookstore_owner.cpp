/**
 * There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for n minutes. Every minute, some number of
 * customers enter the store. You are given an integer array customers of length n where
 * customers[i] is the number of the customer that enters the store at the start of the ith minute
 * and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.
 *
 * On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where
 * grumpy[i] is 1 if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the ith minute, and is 0 otherwise.
 *
 * When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise,
 * they are satisfied.
 *
 * The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for minutes
 * consecutive minutes, but can only use it once.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.
 *
 * ! n == customers.length == grumpy.length
 * ! 1 <= minutes <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * ! 0 <= customers[i] <= 1000
 * ! grumpy[i] is either 0 or 1.
