/**
 * Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
 *
 * A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at
 * least one space.
 *
 * Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
 *
 * Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The
 * returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra
 * spaces.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
 * ! s contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces ' '.
 * ! There is at least one word in s.
