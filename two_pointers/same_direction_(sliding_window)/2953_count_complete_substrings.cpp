/**
 * You are given a string word and an integer k.
 *
 * A substring s of word is complete if:
 *
 * - Each character in s occurs exactly k times.
 *
 * - The difference between two adjacent characters is at most 2. That is, for any two adjacent
 * characters c1 and c2 in s, the absolute difference in their positions in the alphabet is at
 * most 2.
 *
 * Return the number of complete substrings of word.
 *
 * A substring is a non-empty contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
 *
 * ! 1 <= word.length <= 10^5
 * ! word consists only of lowercase English letters.
 * ! 1 <= k <= word.length
