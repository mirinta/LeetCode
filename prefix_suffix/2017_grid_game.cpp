/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D array grid of size 2 x n, where grid[r][c] represents the number of
 * points at position (r, c) on the matrix. Two robots are playing a game on this matrix.
 *
 * Both robots initially start at (0, 0) and want to reach (1, n-1). Each robot may only move to the
 * right ((r, c) to (r, c + 1)) or down ((r, c) to (r + 1, c)).
 *
 * At the start of the game, the first robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting all the
 * points from the cells on its path. For all cells (r, c) traversed on the path, grid[r][c] is set
 * to 0. Then, the second robot moves from (0, 0) to (1, n-1), collecting the points on its path.
 * Note that their paths may intersect with one another.
 *
 * The first robot wants to minimize the number of points collected by the second robot. In
 * contrast, the second robot wants to maximize the number of points it collects. If both robots
 * play optimally, return the number of points collected by the second robot.
 *
 * ! grid.length == 2
 * ! n == grid[r].length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * ! 1 <= grid[r][c] <= 10^5
