 * There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents

 * The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see
 * the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to
 * its right have a smaller height.

 * Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing
 * order.
