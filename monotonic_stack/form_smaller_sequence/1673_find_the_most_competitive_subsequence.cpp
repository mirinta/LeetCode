/**
 * Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of
 * nums of size k.
 *
 * An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements
 * from the array.
 *
 * We define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if
 * in the first position where a and b differ, subsequence a has a number less than the
 * corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the
 * first position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.
 *
 * ! 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * ! 1 <= k <= nums.length
