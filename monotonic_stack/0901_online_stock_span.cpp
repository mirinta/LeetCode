/**
 * Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that
 * stock's price for the current day.
 *
 * The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from
 * that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of
 * that day.
 *
 * - For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the
 * stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock
 * was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.
 *
 * - Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock
 * today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was
 * less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.
 *
 * Implement the StockSpanner class:
 *
 * - StockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.
 *
 * - int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.
 *
 * ! 1 <= price <= 10^5
 * ! At most 104 calls will be made to next.
