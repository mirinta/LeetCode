/**
 * You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.
 *
 * There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive
 * a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <=
 * prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.
 *
 * Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item
 * of the shop, considering the special discount.
 *
 * ! 1 <= prices.length <= 500
 * ! 1 <= prices[i] <= 1000
