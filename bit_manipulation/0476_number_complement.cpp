/**
 * The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the
 * 1's to 0's in its binary representation.
 *
 * For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
 * Given an integer num, return its complement.
 *
 * ! 1 <= num < 2^31
 *
 * ! This question is the same as LC.1009.
