/**
 * An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2n integers where:
 *
 * - Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2n - 1],
 *
 * - The first integer is 0,
 *
 * - An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
 *
 * - The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
 *
 * - The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 16
