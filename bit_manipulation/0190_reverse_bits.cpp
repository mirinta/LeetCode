/**
 * Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * - Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case,
 * both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your
 * implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed
 * or unsigned.
 *
 * - In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore,
 * in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer -3 and the output represents the
 * signed integer -1073741825.
 *
 * ! The input must be a binary string of length 32
