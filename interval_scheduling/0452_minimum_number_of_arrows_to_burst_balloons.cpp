/**
 * There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The
 * balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [x_start, x_end] denotes
 * a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between x_start and x_end. You do not know the
 * exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
 *
 * Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points
 * along the x-axis. A balloon with x_start and x_end is burst by an arrow shot at x if x_start <= x
 * <= x_end. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps
 * traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.
 *
 * Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all
 * balloons.
 *
 * ! 1 <= points.length <= 10^5
 * ! points[i].length == 2
 * ! -2^31 <= x_start < x_end <= 2^31 - 1
