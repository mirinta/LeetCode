/**
 * A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city
 * when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return the
 * skyline formed by these buildings collectively.
 *
 * The geometric information of each building is given in the array buildings where buildings[i] =
 * [left_i, right_i, height_i]:
 *
 * - left_i is the x coordinate of the left edge of the ith building.
 *
 * - right_i is the x coordinate of the right edge of the ith building.
 *
 * - height_i is the height of the ith building.
 *
 * You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at
 * height 0.
 *
 * The skyline should be represented as a list of "key points" sorted by their x-coordinate in the
 * form [[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the
 * skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate 0 and is used to mark
 * the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and
 * rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.
 *
 * Note: There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For
 * instance, [...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...] is not acceptable; the three lines of height
 * 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: [...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...].
 *
 * ! 1 <= buildings.length <= 10^4
 * ! 0 <= left_i < right_i <= 2^31 - 1
 * ! 1 <= height_i <= 2^31 - 1
 * ! buildings are sorted by left_i in non-decreasing order.
