/**
 * A set of real numbers can be represented as the union of several disjoint intervals, where each
 * interval is in the form [a, b). A real number x is in the set if one of its intervals [a, b)
 * contains x (i.e. a <= x < b).
 *
 * You are given a sorted list of disjoint intervals intervals representing a set of real numbers as
 * described above, where intervals[i] = [ai, bi] represents the interval [ai, bi). You are also
 * given another interval toBeRemoved.
 *
 * Return the set of real numbers with the interval toBeRemoved removed from intervals. In other
 * words, return the set of real numbers such that every x in the set is in intervals but not in
 * toBeRemoved. Your answer should be a sorted list of disjoint intervals as described above.
 *
 * ! 1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4
 * ! -10^9 <= ai < bi <= 10^9
