/**
 * Alice and Bob are playing a game on a string.
 *
 * You are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice
 * starts first:
 *
 * - On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number
 * of vowels.
 *
 * - On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of
 * vowels.
 *
 * The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both
 * Alice and Bob play optimally.
 *
 * Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.
 *
 * The English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * ! s consists only of lowercase English letters.
