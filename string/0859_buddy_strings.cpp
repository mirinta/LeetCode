/**
 * Given two strings "s" and "goal", return true if you can swap two letters in "s" so the result is
 * equal to "goal", otherwise, return false.
 *
 * Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and
 * swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].
 *
 * - For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad"
 *
 * ! s and goal consist of lowercase letters.
