/**
 * You are given two strings s and t such that every character occurs at most once in s and t is a
 * permutation of s.
 *
 * The permutation difference between s and t is defined as the sum of the absolute difference
 * between the index of the occurrence of each character in s and the index of the occurrence of the
 * same character in t.
 *
 * Return the permutation difference between s and t.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 26
 * ! Each character occurs at most once in s.
 * ! t is a permutation of s.
 * ! s consists only of lowercase English letters.
