/**
 * The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:
 *
 * - countAndSay(1) = "1"
 *
 * - countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then
 * converted into a different digit string.
 *
 * To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of substrings such
 * that each substring contains exactly one unique digit. Then for each substring, say the number of
 * digits, then say the digit. Finally, concatenate every said digit.
 *
 * Given a positive integer n, return the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 30
