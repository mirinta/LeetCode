/**
 * Given two strings "s" and "t" of lengths "m" and "n" respectively, return the minimum window
 * substring of "s" such that every character in "t" (including duplicates) is included in the
 * window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
 * Output: "BANC"
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "a", t = "a"
 * Output: "a"
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
 * Output: ""
