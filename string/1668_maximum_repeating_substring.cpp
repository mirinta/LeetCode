/**
 * For a string sequence, a string word is k-repeating if word concatenated k times is a substring
 * of sequence. The word's maximum k-repeating value is the highest value k where word is
 * k-repeating in sequence. If word is not a substring of sequence, word's maximum k-repeating value
 * is 0.
 *
 * Given strings sequence and word, return the maximum k-repeating value of word in sequence.
 *
 * ! 1 <= sequence.length <= 100
 * ! 1 <= word.length <= 100
 * ! sequence and word contains only lowercase English letters.
