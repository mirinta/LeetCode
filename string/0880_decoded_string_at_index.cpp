/**
 * You are given an encoded string s. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one
 * character at a time and the following steps are taken:
 *
 * - If the character read is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
 *
 * - If the character read is a digit d, the entire current tape is repeatedly written d - 1 more
 * times in total.
 *
 * Given an integer k, return the kth letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.
 *
 * ! 2 <= s.length <= 100
 * ! s consists of lowercase English letters and digits 2 through 9.
 * ! s starts with a letter.
 * ! 1 <= k <= 10^9
 * ! It is guaranteed that k is less than or equal to the length of the decoded string.
 * ! The decoded string is guaranteed to have less than 2^63 letters.
