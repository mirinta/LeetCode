/**
 * You are given some lists of regions where the first region of each list includes all other
 * regions in that list.
 *
 * Naturally, if a region x contains another region y then x is bigger than y. Also, by definition,
 * a region x contains itself.
 *
 * Given two regions: region1 and region2, return the smallest region that contains both of them.
 *
 * If you are given regions r1, r2, and r3 such that r1 includes r3, it is guaranteed there is no r2
 * such that r2 includes r3.
 *
 * It is guaranteed the smallest region exists.
 *
 * ! 2 <= regions.length <= 104
 * ! 2 <= regions[i].length <= 20
 * ! 1 <= regions[i][j].length, region1.length, region2.length <= 20
 * ! region1 != region2
 * ! regions[i][j], region1, and region2 consist of English letters.
