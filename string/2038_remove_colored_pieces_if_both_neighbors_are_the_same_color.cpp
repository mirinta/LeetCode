/**
 * There are n pieces arranged in a line, and each piece is colored either by 'A' or by 'B'. You are
 * given a string colors of length n where colors[i] is the color of the ith piece.
 *
 * Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take alternating turns removing pieces from the line.
 * In this game, Alice moves first.
 *
 * - Alice is only allowed to remove a piece colored 'A' if both its neighbors are also colored 'A'.
 * She is not allowed to remove pieces that are colored 'B'.
 *
 * - Bob is only allowed to remove a piece
 * colored 'B' if both its neighbors are also colored 'B'. He is not allowed to remove pieces that
 * are colored 'A'.
 *
 * - Alice and Bob cannot remove pieces from the edge of the line.
 *
 * - If a player cannot make a move on their turn, that player loses and the other player wins.
 * Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return true if Alice wins, or return false if Bob wins.
 *
 * ! 1 <= colors.length <= 10^5
 * ! colors consists of only the letters 'A' and 'B'
