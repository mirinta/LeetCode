/**
 * Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following
 * operations:
 *
 * - Operation 1: Swap any two existing characters.
 * For example, abcde -> aecdb
 *
 * - Operation 2: Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing
 * character, and do the same with the other character. For example, aacabb -> bbcbaa (all a's turn
 * into b's, and all b's turn into a's) You can use the operations on either string as many times as
 * necessary.
 *
 * Given two strings, word1 and word2, return true if word1 and word2 are close, and false
 * otherwise.
 *
 * ! 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10^5
 * ! word1 and word2 contain only lowercase English letters.
