/**
 * There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.
 *
 * Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to
 * 25). Initially, your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to
 * the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is
 * |i - j|.
 *
 * You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it
 * with one finger.
 *
 * ! keyboard.length == 26
 * ! keyboard contains each English lowercase letter exactly once in some order.
 * ! 1 <= word.length <= 10^4
 * ! word[i] is an English lowercase letter.
