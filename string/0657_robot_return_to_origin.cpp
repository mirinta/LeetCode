/**
 * There is a robot starting at the position (0, 0), the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of
 * its moves, judge if this robot ends up at (0, 0) after it completes its moves.
 *
 * You are given a string "moves" that represents the move sequence of the robot where moves[i]
 * represents its ith move. Valid moves are 'R' (right), 'L' (left), 'U' (up), and 'D' (down).
 *
 * Return true if the robot returns to the origin after if finishes all of its moves, or false
 * otherwise.
 *
 * Note: the way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. 'R' will always make the robot move to
 * the right once, 'L' will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the
 * robot's movement is the same for each move.
 *
 * ! moves only contains the characters 'U', 'D', 'L' and 'R'.
