/**
 * Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has
 * exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
 *
 * You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each
 * line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.
 *
 * Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces
 * on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more
 * spaces than the slots on the right.
 *
 * For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between
 * words.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * - A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
 *
 * - Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
 *
 * - The input array words contains at least one word.
 *
 * ! 1 <= words.length <= 300
 * ! 1 <= words[i].length <= 20
 * ! words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.
 * ! 1 <= maxWidth <= 100
 * ! words[i].length <= maxWidth
