/**
 * Given a string path, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory
 * in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified canonical path.
 *
 * In a Unix-style file system, a period '.' refers to the current directory, a double period '..'
 * refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. '//') are treated
 * as a single slash '/'. For this problem, any other format of periods such as '...' are treated as
 * file/directory names.
 *
 * The canonical path should have the following format:
 *
 * - The path starts with a single slash '/'.
 *
 * - Any two directories are separated by a single slash '/'.
 *
 * - The path does not end with a trailing '/'.
 *
 * - The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file
 * or directory (i.e., no period '.' or double period '..')
 *
 * Return the simplified canonical path.
 *
 * ! 1 <= path.length <= 3000
 * ! path consists of English letters, digits, period '.', slash '/' or '_'.
 * ! path is a valid absolute Unix path.
