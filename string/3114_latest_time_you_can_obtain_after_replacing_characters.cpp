/**
 * You are given a string s representing a 12-hour format time where some of the digits (possibly
none) are replaced with a "?".
 *
 * 12-hour times are formatted as "HH:MM", where HH is between 00 and 11, and MM is between 00
 * and 59. The earliest 12-hour time is 00:00, and the latest is 11:59.
 *
 * You have to replace all the "?" characters in s with digits such that the time we obtain by the
 * resulting string is a valid 12-hour format time and is the latest possible.
 *
 * Return the resulting string.
 *
 * ! s.length == 5
 * ! s[2] is equal to the character ":".
 * ! All characters except s[2] are digits or "?" characters.
 * ! The input is generated such that there is at least one time between "00:00" and "11:59" that
 * ! you can obtain after replacing the "?" characters.
