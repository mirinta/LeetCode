/**
 * You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string
 * "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no
 * special substring occurs at least thrice.
 *
 * A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 *
 * ! 3 <= s.length <= 50
 * ! s consists of only lowercase English letters.
