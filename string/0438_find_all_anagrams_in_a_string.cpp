/**
 * Given two string "s" and "p", return an array of all the start indicies of "p"'s anagrams in "s".
 * You may return the answer in any order.
 *
 * An anagram is a word or phase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phase,
 * typically using all the original letters exactly once.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
 * Output: [0, 6], because s = {cba}eba{bac}d, "cba" and "bac" are anagrams of "abc".
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
 * Output: [0, 1, 2]
