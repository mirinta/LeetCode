/**
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
 *
 * Symbol   Value
 * I        1
 * V        5
 * X        10
 * L        50
 * C        100
 * D        500
 * M        1000
 *
 * For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as
 * XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
 *
 * Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral
 * for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the
 * five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written
 * as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:
 *
 * - I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
 *
 * - X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
 *
 * - C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
 *
 * Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 15
 * ! s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
 * ! It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].
