/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, and an integer k.
 *
 * In one operation, you will:
 *
 * - Take the two smallest integers x and y in nums.
 *
 * - Remove x and y from nums.
 *
 * - Add min(x, y) * 2 + max(x, y) anywhere in the array.
 *
 * Note that you can only apply the described operation if nums contains at least two elements.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are greater than
 * or equal to k.
 *
 * ! 2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^5
 * ! 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
 * ! 1 <= k <= 10^9
 * ! The input is generated such that an answer always exists. That is, there exists some sequence
 * ! of operations after which all elements of the array are greater than or equal to k.
