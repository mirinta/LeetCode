/**
 * Design a system that manages the reservation state of n seats that are numbered from 1 to n.
 *
 * Implement the SeatManager class:
 *
 * - SeatManager(int n) Initializes a SeatManager object that will manage n seats numbered from 1 to
 * n. All seats are initially available.
 *
 * - int reserve() Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its
 * number.
 *
 * - void unreserve(int seatNumber) Unreserves the seat with the given seatNumber.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= seatNumber <= n
 * ! For each call to reserve, it is guaranteed that there will be at least one unreserved seat.
 * ! For each call to unreserve, it is guaranteed that seatNumber will be reserved.
 * ! At most 10^5 calls in total will be made to reserve and unreserve.
