/**
 * There are n workers. You are given two integer arrays quality and wage where quality[i] is the
 * quality of the ith worker and wage[i] is the minimum wage expectation for the ith worker.
 *
 * We want to hire exactly k workers to form a paid group. To hire a group of k workers, we must pay
 * them according to the following rules:
 *
 * - Every worker in the paid group must be paid at least their minimum wage expectation.
 *
 * - In the group, each worker's pay must be directly proportional to their quality. This means if a
 * workerâ€™s quality is double that of another worker in the group, then they must be paid twice as
 * much as the other worker.
 *
 * Given the integer k, return the least amount of money needed to form a paid group satisfying the
 * above conditions. Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 *
 * ! n == quality.length == wage.length
 * ! 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4
 * ! 1 <= quality[i], wage[i] <= 10^4
