/**
 * You are given an integer array heights representing the heights of buildings, some bricks, and
 * some ladders.
 *
 * You start your journey from building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or
 * ladders.
 *
 * While moving from building i to building i+1 (0-indexed),
 *
 * - If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you do
 * not need a ladder or bricks.
 *
 * - If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use
 * one ladder or (h[i+1] - h[i]) bricks.
 *
 * Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and
 * bricks optimally.
 *
 * ! 1 <= heights.length <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= heights[i] <= 10^6
 * ! 0 <= bricks <= 10^9
 * ! 0 <= ladders <= heights.length
