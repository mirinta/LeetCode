/**
 * Suppose LeetCode will start its IPO soon. In order to sell a good price of its shares to Venture
 * Capital, LeetCode would like to work on some projects to increase its capital before the IPO.
 * Since it has limited resources, it can only finish at most k distinct projects before the IPO.
 * Help LeetCode design the best way to maximize its total capital after finishing at most k
 * distinct projects.
 *
 * You are given n projects where the ith project has a pure profit profits[i] and a minimum capital
 * of capital[i] is needed to start it.
 *
 * Initially, you have w capital. When you finish a project, you will obtain its pure profit and the
 * profit will be added to your total capital.
 *
 * Pick a list of at most k distinct projects from given projects to maximize your final capital,
 * and return the final maximized capital.
 *
 * The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.
 *
 * ! 1 <= k <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= w <= 10^9
 * ! n == profits.length
 * ! n == capital.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= profits[i] <= 10^4
 * ! 0 <= capital[i] <= 10^9
