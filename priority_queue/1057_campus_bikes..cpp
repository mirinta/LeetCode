/**
 * On a campus represented on the X-Y plane, there are n workers and m bikes, with n <= m.
 *
 * You are given an array workers of length n where workers[i] = [xi, yi] is the position of the ith
 * worker. You are also given an array bikes of length m where bikes[j] = [xj, yj] is the position
 * of the jth bike. All the given positions are unique.
 *
 * Assign a bike to each worker. Among the available bikes and workers, we choose the (workeri,
 * bikej) pair with the shortest Manhattan distance between each other and assign the bike to that
 * worker.
 *
 * If there are multiple (workeri, bikej) pairs with the same shortest Manhattan distance, we choose
 * the pair with the smallest worker index. If there are multiple ways to do that, we choose the
 * pair with the smallest bike index. Repeat this process until there are no available workers.
 *
 * Return an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the index (0-indexed) of the bike that the
 * ith worker is assigned to.
 *
 * The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y
 * - p2.y|.
 *
 * ! n == workers.length
 * ! m == bikes.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= m <= 1000
 * ! workers[i].length == bikes[j].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= xi, yi < 1000
 * ! 0 <= xj, yj < 1000
 * ! All worker and bike locations are unique.
