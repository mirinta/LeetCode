/**
 * You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the ith job,
 * you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
 *
 * You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of
 * difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a
 * job done on that day.
 *
 * You are given an integer array jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the ith job is
 * jobDifficulty[i].
 *
 * Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs
 * return -1.
 *
 * ! 1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300
 * ! 0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= d <= 10
