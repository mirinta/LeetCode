/**
 * Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical
 * characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number
 * marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string
 * "aabccc" we replace "aa" by "a2" and replace "ccc" by "c3". Thus the compressed string becomes
 * "a2bc3".
 *
 * Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.
 *
 * Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the
 * run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.
 *
 * Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k
 * characters.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 100
 * ! 0 <= k <= s.length
 * ! s contains only lowercase English letters.
