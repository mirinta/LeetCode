 * You are given an m x n matrix grid consisting of positive integers. You can move from a cell in

 * adjacent). The score of a move from a cell with the value c1 to a cell with the value c2 is c2 -
 * c1.
 *
 * You can start at any cell, and you have to make at least one move.
 *
 * Return the maximum total score you can achieve.
