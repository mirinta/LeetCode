/**
 * We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and
 * so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.
 *
 * Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full,
 * any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.
 * When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of
 * those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the
 * floor.)
 *
 * For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of
 * champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of
 * champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After
 * four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two
 * outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.
 *
 * Now after pouring some non-negative integer cups of champagne, return how full the jth glass in
 * the ith row is (both i and j are 0-indexed.)
 *
 * ! 0 <= poured <= 10^9
 * ! 0 <= query_glass <= query_row < 100
