/**
 * You are given two strings, word1 and word2. You want to construct a string in the following
 * manner:
 *
 * - Choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence1 from word1.
 *
 * - Choose some non-empty subsequence subsequence2 from word2.
 *
 * - Concatenate the subsequences: subsequence1 + subsequence2, to make the string.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed in the described manner. If
 * no palindromes can be constructed, return 0.
 *
 * A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none)
 * characters from s without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.
 *
 * ! 1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000
 * ! word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters.
