/**
 * You are given a non-negative integer k. There exists a staircase with an infinite number of
 * stairs, with the lowest stair numbered 0.
 *
 * Alice has an integer jump, with an initial value of 0. She starts on stair 1 and wants to reach
 * stair k using any number of operations. If she is on stair i, in one operation she can:
 *
 * - Go down to stair i - 1. This operation cannot be used consecutively or on stair 0.
 *
 * - Go up to stair i + 2jump. And then, jump becomes jump + 1.
 *
 * Return the total number of ways Alice can reach stair k.
 *
 * Note that it is possible that Alice reaches the stair k, and performs some operations to reach
 * the stair k again.
 *
 * ! 0 <= k <= 10^9
