/**
 * You are given a string s consisting of lowercase letters and an integer k. We call a string t
 * ideal if the following conditions are satisfied:
 *
 * - t is a subsequence of the string s.
 *
 * - The absolute difference in the alphabet order of every two adjacent letters in t is less than
 * or equal to k.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest ideal string.
 *
 * A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no
 * characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
 *
 * Note that the alphabet order is not cyclic. For example, the absolute difference in the alphabet
 * order of 'a' and 'z' is 25, not 1.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= k <= 25
 * ! s consists of lowercase English letters.
