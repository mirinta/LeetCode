 * - A paid painter that paints the ith wall in time[i] units of time and takes cost[i] units of
 * money.
 *
 * - A free painter that paints any wall in 1 unit of time at a cost of 0. But the free painter
 * can only be used if the paid painter is already occupied.
 *
 * Return the minimum amount of money required to paint the n walls.
