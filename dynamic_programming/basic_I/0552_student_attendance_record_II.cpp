/**
 * An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies
 * whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the
 * following three characters:
 *
 * - 'A': Absent.
 *
 * - 'L': Late.
 *
 * - 'P': Present.
 *
 * Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
 *
 * - The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
 *
 * - The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
 *
 * Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a
 * student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 10^9
 * + 7.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
