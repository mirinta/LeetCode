/**
 * You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain

 * connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into
 * on the same night.
 *
 * Given an integer array "nums" representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum
 * amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.
