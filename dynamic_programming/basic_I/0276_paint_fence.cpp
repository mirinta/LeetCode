/**
 * You are painting a fence of n posts with k different colors. You must paint the posts following
 * these rules:
 *
 * - Every post must be painted exactly one color.
 *
 * - There cannot be three or more consecutive posts with the same color.
 *
 * Given the two integers n and k, return the number of ways you can paint the fence.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 50
 * ! 1 <= k <= 10^5
 * ! The test cases are generated such that the answer is in the range [0, 231 - 1] for the given n
