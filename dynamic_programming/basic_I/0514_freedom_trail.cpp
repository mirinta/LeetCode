/**
 * In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to reach a metal dial
 * called the "Freedom Trail Ring" and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.
 *
 * Given a string ring that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string key
 * that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return the minimum number of steps to spell
 * all the characters in the keyword.
 *
 * Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the "12:00" direction. You should spell
 * all the characters in key one by one by rotating ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each
 * character of the string key aligned at the "12:00" direction and then by pressing the center
 * button.
 *
 * At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:
 *
 * 1. You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as one step. The
 * final purpose of the rotation is to align one of ring's characters at the "12:00" direction,
 * where this character must equal key[i].
 *
 * 2. If the character key[i] has been aligned at the "12:00" direction, press the center button to
 * spell, which also counts as one step. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next
 * character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.
 *
 * ! 1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100
 * ! ring and key consist of only lower case English letters.
 * ! It is guaranteed that key could always be spelled by rotating ring.
