/**
 * There is a row of "n" houses, where each house can be painted one of three colors: red, blue, or
 * green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all
 * the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.
 *
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by an n x 3 cost matrix
 * costs.
 *
 * - for example, cost[0][0] is the cost of painting house[0] with the color red; cost[1][2] is the
 * cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on...
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to paint all houses.
 *
 * ! costs.length == n
 * ! costs[i].length == 3
 * ! 1 <= n <= 100
 * ! 1 <= costs[i][j] <= 20
