/**
 * There is a row of m houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the n colors
 * (labeled from 1 to n), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted
 * again.
 *
 * A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.
 *
 * - For example: houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1] contains 5 neighborhoods [{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2},
 * {1,1}].
 *
 * Given an array houses, an m x n matrix cost and an integer target where:
 *
 * - houses[i]: is the color of the house i, and 0 if the house is not painted yet.
 *
 * - cost[i][j]: is the cost of paint the house i with the color j + 1.
 *
 * Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly
 * target neighborhoods. If it is not possible, return -1.
 *
 * ! m == houses.length == cost.length
 * ! n == cost[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m <= 100
 * ! 1 <= n <= 20
 * ! 1 <= target <= m
 * ! 0 <= houses[i] <= n
 * ! 1 <= cost[i][j] <= 10^4
