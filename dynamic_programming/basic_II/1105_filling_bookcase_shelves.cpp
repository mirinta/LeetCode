/**
 * You are given an array books where books[i] = [thicknessi, heighti] indicates the thickness and
 * height of the ith book. You are also given an integer shelfWidth.
 *
 * We want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a total width shelfWidth.
 *
 * We choose some of the books to place on this shelf such that the sum of their thickness is less
 * than or equal to shelfWidth, then build another level of the shelf of the bookcase so that the
 * total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.
 * We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.
 *
 * Note that at each step of the above process, the order of the books we place is the same order as
 * the given sequence of books.
 *
 * - For example, if we have an ordered list of 5 books, we might place the first and second book
 * onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the
 * last shelf.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this
 * manner.
 *
 * ! 1 <= books.length <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= thickness_i <= shelfWidth <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= height_i <= 1000
