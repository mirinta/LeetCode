/**
 * You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.
 *
 * wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA
 * without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.
 *
 * - For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
 *
 * A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a
 * predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a
 * word chain with k == 1.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of
 * words.
 *
 * ! 1 <= words.length <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= words[i].length <= 16
 * ! words[i] only consists of lowercase English letters.
