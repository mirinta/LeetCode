/**
 * You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the
 * team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the
 * players in the team.
 *
 * However, the basketball team is not allowed to have conflicts. A conflict exists if a younger
 * player has a strictly higher score than an older player. A conflict does not occur between
 * players of the same age.
 *
 * Given two lists, scores and ages, where each scores[i] and ages[i] represents the score and age
 * of the ith player, respectively, return the highest overall score of all possible basketball
 * teams.
 *
 * ! 1 <= scores.length, ages.length <= 1000
 * ! scores.length == ages.length
 * ! 1 <= scores[i] <= 10^6
 * ! 1 <= ages[i] <= 1000
