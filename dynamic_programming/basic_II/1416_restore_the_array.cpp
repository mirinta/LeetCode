/**
 * A program was supposed to print an array of integers. The program forgot to print whitespaces and
 * the array is printed as a string of digits s and all we know is that all integers in the array
 * were in the range [1, k] and there are no leading zeros in the array.
 *
 * Given the string s and the integer k, return the number of the possible arrays that can be
 * printed as s using the mentioned program. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo
 * 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * ! s consists of only digits and does not contain leading zeros.
 * ! 1 <= k <= 10^9
