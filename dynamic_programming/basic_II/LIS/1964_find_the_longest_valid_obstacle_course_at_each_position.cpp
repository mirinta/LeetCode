/**
 * You want to build some obstacle courses. You are given a 0-indexed integer array "obstacles" of
 * length "n", where obstacles[i] describes the height of the ith obstacle.
 *
 * For every index i between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), find the length of the longest obstacle course
 * in obstacles such that:
 *
 * - You choose any number of obstacles between 0 and i inclusive.
 *
 * - You must include the ith obstacle in the course.
 *
 * - You must put the chosen obstacles in the same order as they appear in obstacles.
 *
 * - Every obstacle (expect the first) is taller than or the same height as the obstacle immediately
 * before it.
 *
 * Return an array "ans" of length n, where ans[i] is the length of the longest obstacle course for
 * index i as described above.
 *
 * ! n == obstacles.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= obstacles[i] <= 10^7
