/**
 * There is a group of n members, and a list of various crimes they could commit. The ith crime
 * generates a profit[i] and requires group[i] members to participate in it. If a member
 * participates in one crime, that member can't participate in another crime.
 *
 * Let's call a profitable scheme any subset of these crimes that generates at least minProfit
 * profit, and the total number of members participating in that subset of crimes is at most n.
 *
 * Return the number of schemes that can be chosen. Since the answer may be very large, return it
 * modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 100
 * ! 0 <= minProfit <= 100

 * ! profit.length == group.length
 * ! 0 <= profit[i] <= 100
