/**
 * You are given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]. The ith event
 * starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value
 * of valuei. You are also given an integer k which represents the maximum number of events you can
 * attend.
 *
 * You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the
 * entire event. Note that the end day is inclusive: that is, you cannot attend two events where one
 * of them starts and the other ends on the same day.
 *
 * Return the maximum sum of values that you can receive by attending events.
 *
 * ! 1 <= k <= events.length
 * ! 1 <= k * events.length <= 10^6
 * ! 1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^9
 * ! 1 <= valuei <= 10^6
