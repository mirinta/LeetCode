/**
 * Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".
 *
 * Alice starts with 0 points and draws numbers while she has less than k points. During each draw,
 * she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, maxPts], where maxPts is an
 * integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.
 *
 * Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets k or more points.
 *
 * Return the probability that Alice has n or fewer points.
 *
 * Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer are considered accepted.
 *
 * ! 0 <= k <= n <= 10^4
 * ! 1 <= maxPts <= 10^4
