/**
 * You are given four integers minLength, maxLength, oneGroup and zeroGroup.
 *
 * A binary string is good if it satisfies the following conditions:
 *
 * - The length of the string is in the range [minLength, maxLength].
 *
 * - The size of each block of consecutive 1's is a multiple of oneGroup. For example in a binary
 * string 00110111100 sizes of each block of consecutive ones are [2,4].
 *
 * - The size of each block of consecutive 0's is a multiple of zeroGroup. For example, in a binary
 * string 00110111100 sizes of each block of consecutive zeros are [2,1,2].
 *
 * Return the number of good binary strings. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo
 * 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * Note that 0 is considered a multiple of all the numbers.
 *
 * ! 1 <= minLength <= maxLength <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= oneGroup, zeroGroup <= maxLength
