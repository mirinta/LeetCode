/**
 * A train line going through a city has two routes, the regular route and the express route. Both
 * routes go through the same n + 1 stops labeled from 0 to n. Initially, you start on the regular
 * route at stop 0.
 *
 * You are given two 1-indexed integer arrays regular and express, both of length n. regular[i]
 * describes the cost it takes to go from stop i - 1 to stop i using the regular route, and
 * express[i] describes the cost it takes to go from stop i - 1 to stop i using the express route.
 *
 * You are also given an integer expressCost which represents the cost to transfer from the regular
 * route to the express route.
 *
 * Note that:
 *
 * - There is no cost to transfer from the express route back to the regular route.
 *
 * - You pay expressCost every time you transfer from the regular route to the express route.
 *
 * - There is no extra cost to stay on the express route.
 *
 * Return a 1-indexed array costs of length n, where costs[i] is the minimum cost to reach stop i
 * from stop 0.
 *
 * Note that a stop can be counted as reached from either route.
 *
 * ! n == regular.length == express.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= regular[i], express[i], expressCost <= 10^5
