/**
 * You are given an array of distinct positive integers locations where locations[i] represents the
 * position of city i. You are also given integers start, finish and fuel representing the starting
 * city, ending city, and the initial amount of fuel you have, respectively.
 *
 * At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that j != i and 0 <= j <
 * locations.length and move to city j. Moving from city i to city j reduces the amount of fuel you
 * have by |locations[i] - locations[j]|. Please notice that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
 *
 * Notice that fuel cannot become negative at any point in time, and that you are allowed to visit
 * any city more than once (including start and finish).
 *
 * Return the count of all possible routes from start to finish. Since the answer may be too large,
 * return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * ! 2 <= locations.length <= 100
 * ! 1 <= locations[i] <= 10^9
 * ! All integers in locations are distinct.
 * ! 0 <= start, finish < locations.length
 * ! 1 <= fuel <= 200
