/**
 * A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit,
 * there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the
 * water.
 *
 * Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can
 * cross the river by landing on the last stone. Initially, the frog is on the first stone and
 * assumes the first jump must be 1 unit.
 *
 * If the frog's last jump was k units, its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. The
 * frog can only jump in the forward direction.
 *
 * ! 2 <= stones.length <= 2000
 * ! 0 <= stones[i] <= 2^31 - 1
 * ! stones[0] == 0
 * ! stones is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
