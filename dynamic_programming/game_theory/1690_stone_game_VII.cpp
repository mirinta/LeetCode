/**
 * Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
 *
 * There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost
 * stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining
 * stones' values in the row. The winner is the one with the higher score when there are no stones
 * left to remove.
 *
 * Bob found that he will always lose this game (poor Bob, he always loses), so he decided to
 * minimize the score's difference. Alice's goal is to maximize the difference in the score.
 *
 * Given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone from the
 * left, return the difference in Alice and Bob's score if they both play optimally.
 *
 * ! n == stones.length
 * ! 2 <= n <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
