/**
 * You are given an integer array nums. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and
 * player 2.
 *
 * Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with
 * a score of 0. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array
 * (i.e., nums[0] or nums[nums.length - 1]) which reduces the size of the array by 1. The player
 * adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the
 * array.
 *
 * Return true if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1
 * is still the winner, and you should also return true. You may assume that both players are
 * playing optimally.
 *
 * ! 1 <= nums.length <= 20
 * ! 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^7
