/**
 * Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
 *
 * There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is more
 * than one, they will do the following:
 *
 * Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row.
 * Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score.
 * Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.
 * The game stops when only one stone is left in the row.
 *
 * The score difference between Alice and Bob is (Alice's score - Bob's score). Alice's goal is to
 * maximize the score difference, and Bob's goal is the minimize the score difference.
 *
 * Given an integer array stones of length n where stones[i] represents the value of the ith stone
 * from the left, return the score difference between Alice and Bob if they both play optimally.
 *
 * ! n == stones.length
 * ! 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! -10^4 <= stones[i] <= 10^4
