/**
 * In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from 1 to 10.
 * The player who first causes the running total to reach or exceed 100 wins.
 *
 * What if we change the game so that players cannot re-use integers?
 *
 * For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15
 * without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.
 *
 * Given two integers maxChoosableInteger and desiredTotal, return true if the first player to move
 * can force a win, otherwise, return false. Assume both players play optimally.
 *
 * ! 1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20
 * ! 0 <= desiredTotal <= 300
