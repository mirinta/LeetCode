/**
 * Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a
 * row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.
 *
 * Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take
 * 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
 *
 * The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player
 * is 0 initially.
 *
 * The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the
 * highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
 *
 * Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
 *
 * Return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win, or "Tie" if they will end the game with
 * the same score.
 *
 * ! 1 <= stoneValue.length <= 5 * 104
 * ! -1000 <= stoneValue[i] <= 1000
