/**
 * The demons had captured the princess and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon.
 * The dungeon consists of m x n rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight was initially
 * positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through dungeon to rescue the princess.
 *
 * The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his
 * health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
 *
 * Some of the rooms are guarded by demons (represented by negative integers), so the knight loses
 * health upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (represented as 0) or contain
 * magic orbs that increase the knight's health (represented by positive integers).
 *
 * To reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or
 * downward in each step.
 *
 * Return the knight's minimum initial health so that he can rescue the princess.
 *
 * Note that any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and
 * the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.
 *
 * ! m == dungeon.length
 * ! n == dungeon[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 200
 * ! -1000 <= dungeon[i][j] <= 1000
