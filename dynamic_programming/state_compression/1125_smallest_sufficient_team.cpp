/**
 * In a project, you have a list of required skills req_skills, and a list of people. The ith person
 * people[i] contains a list of skills that the person has.
 *
 * Consider a sufficient team: a set of people such that for every required skill in req_skills,
 * there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. We can represent these teams by the
 * index of each person.
 *
 * For example, team = [0, 1, 3] represents the people with skills people[0], people[1], and
 * people[3]. Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the index of
 * each person. You may return the answer in any order.
 *
 * It is guaranteed an answer exists.
 *
 * ! 1 <= req_skills.length <= 16
 * ! 1 <= req_skills[i].length <= 16
 * ! req_skills[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
 * ! All the strings of req_skills are unique.
 * ! 1 <= people.length <= 60
 * ! 0 <= people[i].length <= 16
 * ! 1 <= people[i][j].length <= 16
 * ! people[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
 * ! All the strings of people[i] are unique.
 * ! Every skill in people[i] is a skill in req_skills.
 * ! It is guaranteed a sufficient team exists.
