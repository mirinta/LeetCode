/**
 * On a campus represented as a 2D grid, there are n workers and m bikes, with n <= m. Each worker
 * and bike is a 2D coordinate on this grid.
 *
 * We assign one unique bike to each worker so that the sum of the Manhattan distances between each
 * worker and their assigned bike is minimized.
 *
 * Return the minimum possible sum of Manhattan distances between each worker and their assigned
 * bike.
 *
 * The Manhattan distance between two points p1 and p2 is Manhattan(p1, p2) = |p1.x - p2.x| + |p1.y
 * - p2.y|.
 *
 *
 * ! n == workers.length
 * ! m == bikes.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= m <= 10
 * ! workers[i].length == 2
 * ! bikes[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= workers[i][0], workers[i][1], bikes[i][0], bikes[i][1] < 1000
 * ! All the workers and the bikes locations are unique.
