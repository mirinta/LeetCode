/**
 * You are given two non-negative integer arrays price and tastiness, both arrays have the same
 * length n. You are also given two non-negative integers maxAmount and maxCoupons.
 *
 * For every integer i in range [0, n - 1]:
 *
 * - price[i] describes the price of ith fruit.
 *
 * - tastiness[i] describes the tastiness of ith fruit.
 *
 * You want to purchase some fruits such that total tastiness is maximized and the total price does
 * not exceed maxAmount.
 *
 * Additionally, you can use a coupon to purchase fruit for half of its price (rounded down to the
 * closest integer). You can use at most maxCoupons of such coupons.
 *
 * Return the maximum total tastiness that can be purchased.
 *
 * Note that:
 *
 * - You can purchase each fruit at most once.
 *
 * - You can use coupons on some fruit at most once.
 *
 * ! n == price.length == tastiness.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 100
 * ! 0 <= price[i], tastiness[i], maxAmount <= 1000
 * ! 0 <= maxCoupons <= 5
