/**
 * There is a test that has n types of questions. You are given an integer target and a 0-indexed 2D
 * integer array types where types[i] = [counti, marksi] indicates that there are counti questions
 * of the ith type, and each one of them is worth marksi points.
 *
 * Return the number of ways you can earn exactly target points in the exam. Since the answer may be
 * too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * Note that questions of the same type are indistinguishable.
 *
 * For example, if there are 3 questions of the same type, then solving the 1st and 2nd questions is
 * the same as solving the 1st and 3rd questions, or the 2nd and 3rd questions.
 *
 * ! 1 <= target <= 1000
 * ! n == types.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 50
 * ! types[i].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= counti, marksi <= 50
