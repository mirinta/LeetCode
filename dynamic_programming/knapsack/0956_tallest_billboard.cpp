/**
 * You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have
 * two steel supports, one on each side. Each steel support must be an equal height.
 *
 * You are given a collection of rods that can be welded together. For example, if you have rods of
 * lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.
 *
 * Return the largest possible height of your billboard installation. If you cannot support the
 * billboard, return 0.
 *
 * ! 1 <= rods.length <= 20
 * ! 1 <= rods[i] <= 1000
 * ! sum(rods[i]) <= 5000
