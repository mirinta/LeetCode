/**
 * Alice is texting Bob using her phone. The mapping of digits to letters is shown in the figure
 * below.
 *
 * In order to add a letter, Alice has to press the key of the corresponding digit i times, where i
 * is the position of the letter in the key.
 *
 * - For example, to add the letter 's', Alice has to press '7' four times. Similarly, to add the
 * letter 'k', Alice has to press '5' twice.
 *
 * - Note that the digits '0' and '1' do not map to any letters, so Alice does not use them.
 *
 * However, due to an error in transmission, Bob did not receive Alice's text message but received a
 * string of pressed keys instead.
 *
 * - For example, when Alice sent the message "bob", Bob received the string "2266622".
 *
 * Given a string pressedKeys representing the string received by Bob, return the total number of
 * possible text messages Alice could have sent.
 *
 * Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * ! 1 <= pressedKeys.length <= 10^5
 * ! pressedKeys only consists of digits from '2' - '9'.
