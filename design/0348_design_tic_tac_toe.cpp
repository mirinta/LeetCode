/**
 * Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:
 *
 * - 1. A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
 *
 * - 2. Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
 *
 * - 3. A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row
 * wins the game.
 *
 * Implement the TicTacToe class:
 *
 * - TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n.
 *
 * - int move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player with id player plays at the
 * cell (row, col) of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move, and the two players
 * alternate in making moves. Return
 *
 * - 0 if there is no winner after the move,
 *
 * - 1 if player 1 is the winner after the move, or
 *
 * - 2 if player 2 is the winner after the move.
