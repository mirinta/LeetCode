/**
 * Design a Leaderboard class, which has 3 functions:
 *
 * 1. addScore(playerId, score): Update the leaderboard by adding score to the given player's score.
 * If there is no player with such id in the leaderboard, add him to the leaderboard with the given
 * score.
 *
 * 2. top(K): Return the score sum of the top K players.
 *
 * 3. reset(playerId): Reset the score of the player with the given id to 0 (in other words erase it
 * from the leaderboard). It is guaranteed that the player was added to the leaderboard before
 * calling this function.
 *
 * Initially, the leaderboard is empty.
 *
 * ! 1 <= playerId, K <= 10000
 * ! It's guaranteed that K is less than or equal to the current number of players.
 * ! 1 <= score <= 100
 * ! There will be at most 1000 function calls.
