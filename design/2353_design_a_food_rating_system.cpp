/**
 * Design a food rating system that can do the following:
 *
 * - Modify the rating of a food item listed in the system.
 *
 * - Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.
 *
 * Implement the FoodRatings class:
 *
 * - FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings) Initializes the system. The food
 * items are described by foods, cuisines and ratings, all of which have a length of n.
 *
 *     - foods[i] is the name of the ith food,
 *
 *     - cuisines[i] is the type of cuisine of the ith food, and
 *
 *     - ratings[i] is the initial rating of the ith food.
 *
 * - void changeRating(String food, int newRating) Changes the rating of the food item with the name
 * food.
 *
 * - String highestRated(String cuisine) Returns the name of the food item that has the highest
 * rating for the given type of cuisine. If there is a tie, return the item with the
 * lexicographically smaller name.
 *
 * Note that a string x is lexicographically smaller than string y if x comes before y in dictionary
 * order, that is, either x is a prefix of y, or if i is the first position such that x[i] != y[i],
 * then x[i] comes before y[i] in alphabetic order.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * ! n == foods.length == cuisines.length == ratings.length
 * ! 1 <= foods[i].length, cuisines[i].length <= 10
 * ! foods[i], cuisines[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
 * ! 1 <= ratings[i] <= 10^8
 * ! All the strings in foods are distinct.
 * ! food will be the name of a food item in the system across all calls to changeRating.
 * ! cuisine will be a type of cuisine of at least one food item in the system across all calls to
 * ! highestRated.
 * ! At most 2 * 10^4 calls in total will be made to changeRating and highestRated.
