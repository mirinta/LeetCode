/**
 * Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces:
 * big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.
 *
 * Implement the ParkingSystem class:
 *
 * - ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class.
 * The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
 *
 * - bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that
 * wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which
 * are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its
 * carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and
 * return true.
 *
 * ! 0 <= big, medium, small <= 1000
 * ! carType is 1, 2, or 3
 * ! At most 1000 calls will be made to addCar
