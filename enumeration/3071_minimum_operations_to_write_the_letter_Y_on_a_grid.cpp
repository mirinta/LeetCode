/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed n x n grid where n is odd, and grid[r][c] is 0, 1, or 2.
 *
 * We say that a cell belongs to the Letter Y if it belongs to one of the following:
 *
 * - The diagonal starting at the top-left cell and ending at the center cell of the grid.
 *
 * - The diagonal starting at the top-right cell and ending at the center cell of the grid.
 *
 * - The vertical line starting at the center cell and ending at the bottom border of the grid.
 *
 * The Letter Y is written on the grid if and only if:
 *
 * - All values at cells belonging to the Y are equal.
 *
 * - All values at cells not belonging to the Y are equal.
 *
 * - The values at cells belonging to the Y are different from the values at cells not belonging to
 * the Y.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations needed to write the letter Y on the grid given that in
 * one operation you can change the value at any cell to 0, 1, or 2.
 *
 * ! 3 <= n <= 49
 * ! n == grid.length == grid[i].length
 * ! 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 2
 * ! n is odd.
