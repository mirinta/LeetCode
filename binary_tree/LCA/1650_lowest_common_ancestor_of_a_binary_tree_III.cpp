/**
 * Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).
 *
 * Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:
 *
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q
 * in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be
 * a descendant of itself)."
 *
 * ! The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 10^5].
 * ! -10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
 * ! All Node.val are unique.
 * ! p != q
 * ! p and q exist in the tree.
