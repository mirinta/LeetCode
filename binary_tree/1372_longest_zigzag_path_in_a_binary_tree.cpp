/**
 * You are given the root of a binary tree.
 *
 * A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follow:
 *
 * - Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (right or left).
 *
 * - If the current direction is right, move to the right child of the current node; otherwise, move
 * to the left child.
 *
 * - Change the direction from right to left or from left to right.
 *
 * - Repeat the second and third steps until you can't move in the tree.
 *
 * Zigzag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. (A single node has a length of 0).
 *
 * Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.
 *
 * ! The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 5 * 10^4].
 * ! 1 <= Node.val <= 100
