/**
 * You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) rooted at node 0
 * consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The tree is represented by a 0-indexed array
 * parent of size n, where parent[i] is the parent of node i. Since node 0 is the root, parent[0] ==
 * -1.
 *
 * You are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character assigned to node i.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path
 * have the same character assigned to them.
 *
 * ! n == parent.length == s.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= parent[i] <= n - 1 for all i >= 1
 * ! parent[0] == -1
 * ! parent represents a valid tree.
 * ! s consists of only lowercase English letters.
