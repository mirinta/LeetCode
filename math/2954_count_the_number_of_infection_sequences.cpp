/**
 * You are given an integer n and a 0-indexed integer array sick which is sorted in increasing
 * order.
 *
 * There are n children standing in a queue with positions 0 to n - 1 assigned to them. The array
 * sick contains the positions of the children who are infected with an infectious disease. An
 * infected child at position i can spread the disease to either of its immediate neighboring
 * children at positions i - 1 and i + 1 if they exist and are currently not infected. At most one
 * child who was previously not infected can get infected with the disease in one second.
 *
 * It can be shown that after a finite number of seconds, all the children in the queue will get
 * infected with the disease. An infection sequence is the sequential order of positions in which
 * all of the non-infected children get infected with the disease. Return the total number of
 * possible infection sequences.
 *
 * Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 * Note that an infection sequence does not contain positions of children who were already infected
 * with the disease in the beginning.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= sick.length <= n - 1
 * ! 0 <= sick[i] <= n - 1
 * ! sick is sorted in increasing order.
