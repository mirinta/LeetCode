/**
 * You are given two positive integers n and k. There are n children numbered from 0 to n - 1
 * standing in a queue in order from left to right.
 *
 * Initially, child 0 holds a ball and the direction of passing the ball is towards the right
 * direction. After each second, the child holding the ball passes it to the child next to them.
 * Once the ball reaches either end of the line, i.e. child 0 or child n - 1, the direction of
 * passing is reversed.
 *
 * Return the number of the child who receives the ball after k seconds.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 50
 * ! 1 <= k <= 50
