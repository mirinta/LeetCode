/**
 * You are given two integers height and width representing a garden of size height x width. You are
 * also given:
 *
 * - an array tree where tree = [treer, treec] is the position of the tree in the garden,
 *
 * - an array squirrel where squirrel = [squirrelr, squirrelc] is the position of the squirrel in
 * the garden,
 *
 * - and an array nuts where nuts[i] = [nutir, nutic] is the position of the ith nut in the garden.
 *
 * The squirrel can only take at most one nut at one time and can move in four directions: up, down,
 * left, and right, to the adjacent cell.
 *
 * Return the minimal distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree
 * one by one.
 *
 * The distance is the number of moves.
 *
 * ! 1 <= height, width <= 100
 * ! tree.length == 2
 * ! squirrel.length == 2
 * ! 1 <= nuts.length <= 5000
 * ! nuts[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= treer, squirrelr, nutir <= height
 * ! 0 <= treec, squirrelc, nutic <= width
