/**
 * Alice and Bob are playing a turn-based game on a circular field surrounded by flowers. The circle
 * represents the field, and there are x flowers in the clockwise direction between Alice and Bob,
 * and y flowers in the anti-clockwise direction between them.
 *
 * The game proceeds as follows:
 *
 * 1. Alice takes the first turn.
 *
 * 2. In each turn, a player must choose either the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction and pick
 * one flower from that side.
 *
 * 3. At the end of the turn, if there are no flowers left at all, the current player captures their
 * opponent and wins the game.
 *
 * Given two integers, n and m, the task is to compute the number of possible pairs (x, y) that
 * satisfy the conditions:
 *
 * - Alice must win the game according to the described rules.
 *
 * - The number of flowers x in the clockwise direction must be in the range [1,n].
 *
 * - The number of flowers y in the anti-clockwise direction must be in the range [1,m].
 *
 * Return the number of possible pairs (x, y) that satisfy the conditions mentioned in the
 * statement.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n, m <= 10^5
