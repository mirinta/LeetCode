/**
 * An axis-aligned rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) is the
 * coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) is the coordinate of its top-right corner. Its
 * top and bottom edges are parallel to the X-axis, and its left and right edges are parallel to the
 * Y-axis.
 *
 * Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive. To be clear, two rectangles
 * that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.
 *
 * Given two axis-aligned rectangles rec1 and rec2, return true if they overlap, otherwise return
 * false.
 *
 * ! rec1.length == 4
 * ! rec2.length == 4
 * ! -10^9 <= rec1[i], rec2[i] <= 10^9
 * ! rec1 and rec2 represent a valid rectangle with a non-zero area.
