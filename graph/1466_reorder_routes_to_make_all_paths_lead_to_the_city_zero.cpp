/**
 * There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 roads such that there is only one way to
 * travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of
 * transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.
 *
 * Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a road from city
 * ai to city bi.
 *
 * This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to
 * this city.
 *
 * Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the
 * minimum number of edges changed.
 *
 * It's guaranteed that each city can reach city 0 after reorder.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * ! connections.length == n - 1
 * ! connections[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= ai, bi <= n - 1
 * ! ai != bi
