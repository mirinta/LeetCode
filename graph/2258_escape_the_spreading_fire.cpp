/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array grid of size m x n which represents a field. Each cell
 * has one of three values:
 *
 * - 0 represents grass,
 *
 * - 1 represents fire,
 *
 * - 2 represents a wall that you and fire cannot pass through.
 *
 * You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you want to travel to the safehouse at the
 * bottom-right cell, (m - 1, n - 1). Every minute, you may move to an adjacent grass cell. After
 * your move, every fire cell will spread to all adjacent cells that are not walls.
 *
 * Return the maximum number of minutes that you can stay in your initial position before moving
 * while still safely reaching the safehouse. If this is impossible, return -1. If you can always
 * reach the safehouse regardless of the minutes stayed, return 109.
 *
 * Note that even if the fire spreads to the safehouse immediately after you have reached it, it
 * will be counted as safely reaching the safehouse.
 *
 * A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the
 * latter (i.e., their sides are touching).
 *
 * ! m == grid.length
 * ! n == grid[i].length
 * ! 2 <= m, n <= 300
 * ! 4 <= m * n <= 2 * 10^4
 * ! grid[i][j] is either 0, 1, or 2.
 * ! grid[0][0] == grid[m - 1][n - 1] == 0
