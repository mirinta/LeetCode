/**
 * Two strings, X and Y, are considered similar if either they are identical or we can make them
 * equivalent by swapping at most two letters (in distinct positions) within the string X.
 *
 * For example, "tars" and "rats" are similar (swapping at positions 0 and 2), and "rats" and "arts"
 * are similar, but "star" is not similar to "tars", "rats", or "arts".
 *
 * Together, these form two connected groups by similarity: {"tars", "rats", "arts"} and {"star"}.
 * Notice that "tars" and "arts" are in the same group even though they are not similar.  Formally,
 * each group is such that a word is in the group if and only if it is similar to at least one other
 * word in the group.
 *
 * We are given a list strs of strings where every string in strs is an anagram of every other
 * string in strs. How many groups are there?
 *
 * ! 1 <= strs.length <= 300
 * ! 1 <= strs[i].length <= 300
 * ! strs[i] consists of lowercase letters only.
 * ! All words in strs have the same length and are anagrams of each other.
