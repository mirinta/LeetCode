/**
 * There is a company with n branches across the country, some of which are connected by roads.
 * Initially, all branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.
 *
 * The company has realized that they are spending an excessive amount of time traveling between
 * their branches. As a result, they have decided to close down some of these branches (possibly
 * none). However, they want to ensure that the remaining branches have a distance of at most
 * maxDistance from each other.
 *
 * The distance between two branches is the minimum total traveled length needed to reach one branch
 * from another.
 *
 * You are given integers n, maxDistance, and a 0-indexed 2D array roads, where roads[i] = [ui, vi,
 * wi] represents the undirected road between branches ui and vi with length wi.
 *
 * Return the number of possible sets of closing branches, so that any branch has a distance of at
 * most maxDistance from any other.
 *
 *
 * Note that, after closing a branch, the company will no longer have access to any roads connected
 * to it.
 *
 * Note that, multiple roads are allowed.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10
 * ! 1 <= maxDistance <= 105
 * ! 0 <= roads.length <= 1000
 * ! roads[i].length == 3
 * ! 0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
 * ! ui != vi
 * ! 1 <= wi <= 1000
 * ! All branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.
