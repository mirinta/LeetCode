/**
 * There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces (represented as 0) and walls (represented as 1). The
 * ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop
 * rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction.
 *
 * Given the m x n maze, the ball's start position and the destination, where start = [start_row,
 * start_col] and destination = [destination_row, destination_col], return the shortest distance for
 * the ball to stop at the destination. If the ball cannot stop at destination, return -1.
 *
 * The distance is the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position
 * (excluded) to the destination (included).
 *
 * You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls (see examples).
 *
 * ! m == maze.length
 * ! n == maze[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 100
 * ! maze[i][j] is 0 or 1.
 * ! start.length == 2
 * ! destination.length == 2
 * ! 0 <= start_row, destination_row < m
 * ! 0 <= start_col, destination_col < n
 * ! Both the ball and the destination exist in an empty space, and they will not be in the same
 * ! position initially.
 * ! The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces.
