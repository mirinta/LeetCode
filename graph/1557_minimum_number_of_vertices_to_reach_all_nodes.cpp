/**
 * Given a directed acyclic graph, with "n" vertices numbered from 0 to n - 1, and an array "edges"
 * where "edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]" represents a directed edge from node "from_i" to node "to_i".
 *
 * Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's
 * guaranteed that a unique solution exists.
 *
 * Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
 *
 * ! n >= 2
 * ! edges.length >= 1
 * ! edges[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= from_i, to_i < n
 * ! All pairs (from_i, to_i) are distinct.
