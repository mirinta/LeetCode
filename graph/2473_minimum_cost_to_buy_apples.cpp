/**
 * You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given
 * a 2D array roads, where roads[i] = [ai, bi, costi] indicates that there is a bidirectional road
 * between cities ai and bi with a cost of traveling equal to costi.
 *
 * You can buy apples in any city you want, but some cities have different costs to buy apples. You
 * are given the 1-based array appleCost where appleCost[i] is the cost of buying one apple from
 * city i.
 *
 * You start at some city, traverse through various roads, and eventually buy exactly one apple from
 * any city. After you buy that apple, you have to return back to the city you started at, but now
 * the cost of all the roads will be multiplied by a given factor k.
 *
 * Given the integer k, return a 1-based array answer of size n where answer[i] is the minimum total
 * cost to buy an apple if you start at city i.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= roads.length <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= ai, bi <= n
 * ! ai != bi
 * ! 1 <= costi <= 10^5
 * ! appleCost.length == n
 * ! 1 <= appleCost[i] <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= k <= 100
 * ! There are no repeated edges.
