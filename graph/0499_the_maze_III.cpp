/**
 * There is a ball in a maze with empty spaces (represented as 0) and walls (represented as 1). The
 * ball can go through the empty spaces by rolling up, down, left or right, but it won't stop
 * rolling until hitting a wall. When the ball stops, it could choose the next direction. There is
 * also a hole in this maze. The ball will drop into the hole if it rolls onto the hole.
 *
 * Given the m x n maze, the ball's position ball and the hole's position hole, where ball =
 * [ball_row, ball_col] and hole = [hole_row, hole_col], return a string instructions of all the
 * instructions that the ball should follow to drop in the hole with the shortest distance possible.
 * If there are multiple valid instructions, return the lexicographically minimum one. If the ball
 * can't drop in the hole, return "impossible".
 *
 * If there is a way for the ball to drop in the hole, the answer instructions should contain the
 * characters 'u' (i.e., up), 'd' (i.e., down), 'l' (i.e., left), and 'r' (i.e., right).
 *
 * The distance is the number of empty spaces traveled by the ball from the start position
 * (excluded) to the destination (included).
 *
 * You may assume that the borders of the maze are all walls (see examples).
 *
 * ! m == maze.length
 * ! n == maze[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 100
 * ! maze[i][j] is 0 or 1.
 * ! ball.length == 2
 * ! hole.length == 2
 * ! 0 <= ball_row, hole_row <= m
 * ! 0 <= ball_col, hole_col <= n
 * ! Both the ball and the hole exist in an empty space, and they will not be in the same position
 * ! initially.
 * ! The maze contains at least 2 empty spaces.
