/**
 * You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are
 * also given an array relations where relations[i] = [prevCourse_i, nextCourse_i], representing a
 * prerequisite relationship between course prevCourse_i and course nextCourse_i: course
 * prevCourse_i has to be taken before course nextCourse_i.
 *
 * In one semester, you can take any number of courses as long as you have taken all the
 * prerequisites in the previous semester for the courses you are taking.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses. If there is no way to take all
 * the courses, return -1.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 5000
 * ! 1 <= relations.length <= 5000
 * ! relations[i].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= prevCourse_i, nextCourse_i <= n
 * ! prevCourse_i != nextCourse_i
 * ! All the pairs [prevCourse_i, nextCourse_i] are unique.
