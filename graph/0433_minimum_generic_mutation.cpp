/**
 * A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from 'A', 'C', 'G',
 * and 'T'.
 *
 * Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string startGene to a gene string endGene
 * where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.
 *
 * - For example, "AACCGGTT" --> "AACCGGTA" is one mutation.
 *
 * There is also a gene bank bank that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in bank
 * to make it a valid gene string.
 *
 * Given the two gene strings startGene and endGene and the gene bank bank, return the minimum
 * number of mutations needed to mutate from startGene to endGene. If there is no such a mutation,
 * return -1.
 *
 * Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.
 *
 * ! 0 <= bank.length <= 10
 * ! startGene.length == endGene.length == bank[i].length == 8
 * ! startGene, endGene, and bank[i] consist of only the characters ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'].
