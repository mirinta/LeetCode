/**
 * A company has "n" employees with a unique ID for each employee from 0 to n - 1. The head of the
 * company is the one with "headID".
 *
 * Each employee has one direct manager given in the manager array where manager[i] is the direct
 * manager of the ith employee, manager[headID] = -1. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination
 * relationships have a tree structure.
 *
 * The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He
 * will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform there subordinates, and so on until all
 * employees know about the urgent news.
 *
 * The ith employee needs informTime[i] minutes to inform all of this direct subordinates (i.e.,
 * After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).
 *
 * Return the number of minutes needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= headID < n
 * ! manager.length == n
 * ! 0 <= manager[i] < n
 * ! manager[headID] == -1
 * ! informTime.length == n
 * ! 0 <= informTime[i] <= 1000
 * ! informTime[i] == 0 if employee i has no subordinates.
 * ! It is guaranteed that all the employees can be informed.
