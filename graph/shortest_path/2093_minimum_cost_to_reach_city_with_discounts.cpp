/**
 * A series of highways connect n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array
 * highways where highways[i] = [city1i, city2i, tolli] indicates that there is a highway that
 * connects city1i and city2i, allowing a car to go from city1i to city2i and vice versa for a cost
 * of tolli.
 *
 * You are also given an integer discounts which represents the number of discounts you have. You
 * can use a discount to travel across the ith highway for a cost of tolli / 2 (integer division).
 * Each discount may only be used once, and you can only use at most one discount per highway.
 *
 * Return the minimum total cost to go from city 0 to city n - 1, or -1 if it is not possible to go
 * from city 0 to city n - 1.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 1000
 * ! 1 <= highways.length <= 1000
 * ! highways[i].length == 3
 * ! 0 <= city1i, city2i <= n - 1
 * ! city1i != city2i
 * ! 0 <= tolli <= 10^5
 * ! 0 <= discounts <= 500
 * ! There are no duplicate highways.
