/**
 * Given an m x n grid. Each cell of the grid has a sign pointing to the next cell you should visit
 * if you are currently in this cell. The sign of grid[i][j] can be:
 *
 * - 1 which means go to the cell to the right. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j + 1])
 *
 * - 2 which means go to the cell to the left. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i][j - 1])
 *
 * - 3 which means go to the lower cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i + 1][j])
 *
 * - 4 which means go to the upper cell. (i.e go from grid[i][j] to grid[i - 1][j])
 *
 * Notice that there could be some signs on the cells of the grid that point outside the grid.
 *
 * You will initially start at the upper left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path that
 * starts from the upper left cell (0, 0) and ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1) following
 * the signs on the grid. The valid path does not have to be the shortest.
 *
 * You can modify the sign on a cell with cost = 1. You can modify the sign on a cell one time only.
 *
 * Return the minimum cost to make the grid have at least one valid path.
 *
 * ! m == grid.length
 * ! n == grid[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 100
 * ! 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 4
