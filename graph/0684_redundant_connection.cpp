/**
 * In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
 *
 * You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one
 * additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not
 * an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where
 * edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.
 *
 * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are
 * multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.
 *
 * ! n == edges.length
 * ! 3 <= n <= 1000
 * ! edges[i].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
 * ! ai != bi
 * ! There are no repeated edges.
 * ! The given graph is connected.
