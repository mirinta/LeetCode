/**
 * A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In
 * other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.
 *
 * Given a tree of n nodes labelled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of n - 1 edges where edges[i] =
 * [ai, bi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes ai and bi in the tree,
 * you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node x as the root, the result
 * tree has height h. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. min(h))  are
 * called minimum height trees (MHTs).
 *
 * Return a list of all MHTs' root labels. You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 * The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root
 * and a leaf.
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
 * ! edges.length == n - 1
 * ! 0 <= ai, bi < n
 * ! ai != bi
 * ! All the pairs (ai, bi) are distinct.
 * ! The given input is guaranteed to be a tree and there will be no repeated edges.
