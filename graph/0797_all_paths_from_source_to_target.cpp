/**
 * Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of "n" nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible
 * paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.
 *
 * The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e.,
 * there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).
 *
 * ! n == graph.length
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 15
 *
 * ! 0 <= graph[i][j] < n
 *
 * ! graph[i][j] != i (i.e., there will be no self-loops)
 *
 * ! All the elements of graph[i] are unique.
 *
 * ! The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
