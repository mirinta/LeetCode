/**
 * You are given an integer n, which indicates that there are n courses labeled from 1 to n. You are
 * also given a 2D integer array relations where relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej] denotes
 * that course prevCoursej has to be completed before course nextCoursej (prerequisite
 * relationship). Furthermore, you are given a 0-indexed integer array time where time[i] denotes
 * how many months it takes to complete the (i+1)th course.
 *
 * You must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses following these
 * rules:
 *
 * - You may start taking a course at any time if the prerequisites are met.
 *
 * - Any number of courses can be taken at the same time.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses.
 *
 * Note: The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the
 * graph is a directed acyclic graph).
 *
 * ! 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4
 * ! 0 <= relations.length <= min(n * (n - 1) / 2, 5 * 10^4)
 * ! relations[j].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= prevCoursej, nextCoursej <= n
 * ! prevCoursej != nextCoursej
 * ! All the pairs [prevCoursej, nextCoursej] are unique.
 * ! time.length == n
 * ! 1 <= time[i] <= 10^4
 * ! The given graph is a directed acyclic graph.
