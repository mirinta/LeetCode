/**
 * There is an infrastructure of n cities with some number of roads connecting these cities. Each
 * roads[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi.
 *
 * The network rank of two different cities is defined as the total number of directly connected
 * roads to either city. If a road is directly connected to both cities, it is only counted once.
 *
 * The maximal network rank of the infrastructure is the maximum network rank of all pairs of
 * different cities.
 *
 * Given the integer n and the array roads, return the maximal network rank of the entire
 * infrastructure.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 100
 * ! 0 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
 * ! roads[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= ai, bi <= n-1
 * ! ai != bi
 * ! Each pair of cities has at most one road connecting them.
