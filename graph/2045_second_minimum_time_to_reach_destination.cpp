/**
 * A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with n vertices where each vertex is
 * labeled from 1 to n (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array
 * edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex
 * vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The
 * time taken to traverse any edge is time minutes.
 *
 * Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every
 * change minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can
 * leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.
 *
 * The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.
 *
 * - For example the second minimum value of [2, 3, 4] is 3, and the second minimum value of [2, 2,
 * 4] is 4. Given n, edges, time, and change, return the second minimum time it will take to go from
 * vertex 1 to vertex n.
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * - You can go through any vertex any number of times, including 1 and n.
 *
 * - You can assume that when the journey starts, all signals have just turned green.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n <= 10^4
 * ! n - 1 <= edges.length <= min(2 * 10^4, n * (n - 1) / 2)
 * ! edges[i].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= ui, vi <= n
 * ! ui != vi
 * ! There are no duplicate edges.
 * ! Each vertex can be reached directly or indirectly from every other vertex.
 * ! 1 <= time, change <= 10^3
