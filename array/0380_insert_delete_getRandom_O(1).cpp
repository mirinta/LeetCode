/**
 * Implement the "RandomizedSet" class:
 *
 * - "RandomizedSet()" initializes the "RandomizedSet" object.
 *
 * - "bool insert(int val)" inserts an item "val" into the set if not present. Returns "true" if the
 * item was not present, "false" otherwise.
 *
 * - "bool remove(int val)" removes an item "val" from the set if present. Returns "true" if the
 * item was present, "false" otherwise.
 *
 * - "int getRandom()" returns a random element from the current set of elements (it's guaranteed
 * that at least one element exists when this method is called). Each element must have the same
 * probability of being returned.
 *
 * ! You must implement the functions of the class such that each function works in average O(1)
 * ! time complexity.
