/**
 * You are given a string s, which contains stars *.
 *
 * In one operation, you can:
 *
 * - Choose a star in s.
 *
 * - Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.
 *
 * Return the string after all stars have been removed.
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * - The input will be generated such that the operation is always possible.
 *
 * - It can be shown that the resulting string will always be unique.
 *
 * ! 1 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * ! s consists of lowercase English letters and stars *.
 * ! The operation above can be performed on s.
