/**
 * You are given an array of integers "stones" where "stones[i]" is the weight of the "i"th stone.
 *
 * We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest two stones and smash
 * them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have weights "w" and "y" with "x <= y". The
 * result of this smash is:
 *
 * - If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
 *
 * - If x != y, the stone of weight "x" is destroyed, and the stone of weight "y" has new weight "y
 * - x".
 *
 * At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
 *
 * Return the weight of the last remaining stones. If there are no stones left, return "0".
