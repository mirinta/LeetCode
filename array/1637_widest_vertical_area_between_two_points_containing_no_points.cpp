/**
 * Given n points on a 2D plane where points[i] = [xi, yi], Return the widest vertical area between
 * two points such that no points are inside the area.
 *
 * A vertical area is an area of fixed-width extending infinitely along the y-axis (i.e., infinite
 * height). The widest vertical area is the one with the maximum width.
 *
 * Note that points on the edge of a vertical area are not considered included in the area.
 *
 * ! n == points.length
 * ! 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * ! points[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= xi, yi <= 10^9
