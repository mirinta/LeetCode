/**
 * According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular
 * automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 *
 * The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: live
 * (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors
 * (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia
 * article):
 *
 * 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
 *
 * 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 *
 * 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
 *
 * 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 *
 * The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current
 * state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the m x n grid
 * board, return the next state.
 *
 * ! m == board.length
 * ! n == board[i].length
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 25
 * ! board[i][j] is 0 or 1.
