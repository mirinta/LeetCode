/**
 * Tic-tac-toe is played by two players A and B on a 3 x 3 grid. The rules of Tic-Tac-Toe are:
 *
 * - Players take turns placing characters into empty squares ' '.
 *
 * - The first player A always places 'X' characters, while the second player B always places 'O'
 * characters.
 *
 * - 'X' and 'O' characters are always placed into empty squares, never on filled ones.
 *
 * - The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column,
 * or diagonal.
 *
 * - The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
 *
 * - No more moves can be played if the game is over.
 *
 * Given a 2D integer array moves where moves[i] = [row_i, col_i] indicates that the ith move will
 * be played on grid[row_i][col_i]. return the winner of the game if it exists (A or B). In case the
 * game ends in a draw return "Draw". If there are still movements to play return "Pending".
 *
 * You can assume that moves is valid (i.e., it follows the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe), the grid is
 * initially empty, and A will play first.
 *
 * ! moves[i].length == 2
 * ! 0 <= rowi, coli <= 2
 * ! There are no repeated elements on moves.
 * ! moves follow the rules of tic tac toe.
