/**
 * You are given two arrays of equal length, nums1 and nums2.
 *
 * Each element in nums1 has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer,
 * represented by the variable x.
 *
 * As a result, nums1 becomes equal to nums2. Two arrays are considered equal when they contain the
 * same integers with the same frequencies.
 *
 * Return the integer x.
 *
 * ! 1 <= nums1.length == nums2.length <= 100
 * ! 0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
 * ! The test cases are generated in a way that there is an integer x such that nums1 can become
 * ! equal to nums2 by adding x to each element of nums1.
