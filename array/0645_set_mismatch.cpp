/**
 * You have a set of integers s, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n.
 * Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in s got duplicated to another number in the
 * set, which results in repetition of one number and loss of another number.
 *
 * You are given an integer array nums representing the data status of this set after the error.
 *
 * Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of
 * an array.
 *
 * ! 2 <= nums.length <= 10^4
 * ! 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
