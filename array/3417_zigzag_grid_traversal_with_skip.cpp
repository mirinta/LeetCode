/**
 * You are given an m x n 2D array grid of positive integers.
 *
 * Your task is to traverse grid in a zigzag pattern while skipping every alternate cell.
 *
 * Zigzag pattern traversal is defined as following the below actions:
 *
 * - Start at the top-left cell (0, 0).
 *
 * - Move right within a row until the end of the row is reached.
 *
 * - Drop down to the next row, then traverse left until the beginning of the row is reached.
 *
 * - Continue alternating between right and left traversal until every row has been traversed.
 *
 * Note that you must skip every alternate cell during the traversal.
 *
 * Return an array of integers result containing, in order, the value of the cells visited during
 * the zigzag traversal with skips.
 *
 * ! 2 <= n == grid.length <= 50
 * ! 2 <= m == grid[i].length <= 50
 * ! 1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2500
