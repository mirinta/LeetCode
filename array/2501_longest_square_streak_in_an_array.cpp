/**
 * You are given an integer array nums. A subsequence of nums is called a square streak if:
 *
 * - The length of the subsequence is at least 2, and
 *
 * - after sorting the subsequence, each element (except the first element) is the square of the
 * previous number.
 *
 * Return the length of the longest square streak in nums, or return -1 if there is no square
 * streak.
 *
 * A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements
 * without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 *
 * ! 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
 * ! 2 <= nums[i] <= 10^5
