/**
 * You are given a 2D 0-indexed array of strings, access_times, with size n. For each i where 0 <= i
 * <= n - 1, access_times[i][0] represents the name of an employee, and access_times[i][1]
 * represents the access time of that employee. All entries in access_times are within the same day.
 *
 * The access time is represented as four digits using a 24-hour time format, for example, "0800" or
 * "2250".
 *
 * An employee is said to be high-access if he has accessed the system three or more times within a
 * one-hour period.
 *
 * Times with exactly one hour of difference are not considered part of the same one-hour period.
 * For example, "0815" and "0915" are not part of the same one-hour period.
 *
 * Access times at the start and end of the day are not counted within the same one-hour period. For
 * example, "0005" and "2350" are not part of the same one-hour period.
 *
 * Return a list that contains the names of high-access employees with any order you want.
 *
 * ! 1 <= access_times.length <= 100
 * ! access_times[i].length == 2
 * ! 1 <= access_times[i][0].length <= 10
 * ! access_times[i][0] consists only of English small letters.
 * ! access_times[i][1].length == 4
 * ! access_times[i][1] is in 24-hour time format.
 * ! access_times[i][1] consists only of '0' to '9'.
