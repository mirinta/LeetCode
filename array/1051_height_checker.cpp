/**
 * A school is tying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand
 * in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the
 * integer array "expected" where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student in line.
 *
 * You are given an integer array "heights" representing the current order that the students are
 * standing in. Each heights[i] is the height of the ith student in line (0-indexed).
 *
 * Return the number of indicies where heights[i] != expected[i]
