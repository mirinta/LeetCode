/**
 * You are given a 0-indexed 1-dimensional (1D) integer array original, and two integers, m and n.
 * You are tasked with creating a 2-dimensional (2D) array with  m rows and n columns using all the
 * elements from original.
 *
 * The elements from indices 0 to n - 1 (inclusive) of original should form the first row of the
 * constructed 2D array, the elements from indices n to 2 * n - 1 (inclusive) should form the second
 * row of the constructed 2D array, and so on.
 *
 * Return an m x n 2D array constructed according to the above procedure, or an empty 2D array if it
 * is impossible.
 *
 * ! 1 <= original.length <= 5 * 10^4
 * ! 1 <= original[i] <= 10^5
 * ! 1 <= m, n <= 4 * 10^4
