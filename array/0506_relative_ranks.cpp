/**
 * You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score of the ith athlete in
 * a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.
 *
 * The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score,
 * the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete
 * determines their rank:
 *
 * - The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
 *
 * - The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
 *
 * - The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
 *
 * - For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth
 * place athlete's rank is "x").
 *
 * Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith athlete.
 *
 * ! n == score.length
 * ! 1 <= n <= 10^4
 * ! 0 <= score[i] <= 10^6
 * ! All the values in score are unique.
