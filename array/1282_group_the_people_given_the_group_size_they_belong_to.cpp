/**
 * There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with
 * a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.
 *
 * You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that
 * person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.
 *
 * Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].
 *
 * Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are
 * multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid
 * solution for the given input.
 *
 * ! groupSizes.length == n
 * ! 1 <= n <= 500
 * ! 1 <= groupSizes[i] <= n
