/**
 * You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game,
 * you start with an empty record.
 *
 * You are given a list of strings "operations", where operations[i] is the ith operation you must
 * apply to the record and is one of the following:
 *
 * - An integer x. Record a new score of x.
 *
 * - '+'. Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
 *
 * - 'D'. Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
 *
 * - 'C'. Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.
 *
 * Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.
 *
 * The test cases are generated such that the answer and all intermediate calculations fit in a
 * 32-bit integer and that all operations are valid.
 *
 * ! operations[i] is "C", "D", "+", or a string representing an integer in range [-3*104, 3*104].
 *
 * ! For operation "+", there will always be at least two previous scores on the record.
 *
 * ! For operations "C" and "D", there will always be at least one previous score on the record.
