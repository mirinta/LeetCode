/**
 * There is a circle of red and blue tiles. You are given an array of integers colors. The color of
 * tile i is represented by colors[i]:
 *
 * - colors[i] == 0 means that tile i is red.
 *
 * - colors[i] == 1 means that tile i is blue.
 *
 * Every 3 contiguous tiles in the circle with alternating colors (the middle tile has a different
 * color from its left and right tiles) is called an alternating group.
 *
 * Return the number of alternating groups.
 *
 * Note that since colors represents a circle, the first and the last tiles are considered to be
 * next to each other.
 *
 * ! 3 <= colors.length <= 100
 * ! 0 <= colors[i] <= 1
