/**
 * On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Return the
 * minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.
 *
 * You can move according to these rules:
 *
 * In 1 second, you can either:
 *
 * - move vertically by one unit,
 *
 * - move horizontally by one unit, or
 *
 * - move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit
 * horizontally in 1 second).
 *
 * You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
 *
 * You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as
 * visits.
 *
 * ! points.length == n
 * ! 1 <= n <= 100
 * ! points[i].length == 2
 * ! -1000 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 1000
